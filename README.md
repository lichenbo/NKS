# A New Kind of Science - Interactive Notes

A client-side web application presenting personal notes and annotations for Stephen Wolfram's groundbreaking book "A New Kind of Science". This project creates an immersive reading experience with a three-column layout featuring chapter outlines, main content, and detailed annotations.

## 🌐 Live Demo

**[View the Interactive Notes](https://lichenbo.github.io/NKS/)**

## ✨ Features

- **Three-Column Layout**: Chapter outline, main content, and detailed annotations
- **Interactive Annotations**: Click on highlighted terms to view detailed explanations with typewriter effects
- **Cellular Automata Background**: Live implementation of Wolfram's Rule 30 creating dynamic visual patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewing
- **Glass-Morphism UI**: Modern design with subtle animations and hover effects
- **Markdown-Based Content**: Easy-to-edit chapter content stored as individual `.md` files

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Pure Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks or build tools required
- **Static File Serving** - All content served as static files, perfect for GitHub Pages
- **Client-Side Rendering** - Uses `marked.js` library for markdown parsing
- **Animation Libraries** - AOS (Animate On Scroll) and Typed.js for visual effects

## 🚀 Local Development

Since this is a static HTML/CSS/JS project, you can run it locally using any static file server:

```bash
# Using Python (recommended)
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx serve

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## 📝 Content Management

### Adding New Chapters
1. Create a new `.md` file in the `chapters/` directory following the pattern `chapter[N].md`
2. Update the chapter list in `index.html`
3. Add any new annotations to the `annotations/` directory

### Creating Annotations
- Add new annotation files to the `annotations/` directory
- Link annotations in markdown using the syntax: `[text](annotation:key)`
- The annotation system automatically processes these links before markdown parsing

### Annotation Linking System
In your markdown files, you can link to annotations like this:
```markdown
The concept of [computational equivalence](annotation:computational-equivalence) suggests that...
```
