# Chapter 2: The Crucial Experiment

## Elementary Cellular Automata

Wolfram systematically explores all 256 possible [elementary cellular automata](annotation:elementary-ca), revealing four classes of behavior.

This systematic approach demonstrates how computational experiments can reveal universal patterns in simple systems.

## Class 4 Behavior

The discovery of [Class 4 automata](annotation:class4) - systems that are neither too simple nor too random - suggests a new category of complex systems at the "edge of chaos".

## The Four Classes

1. **Class 1**: Evolution leads to homogeneous state
2. **Class 2**: Evolution leads to simple stable or periodic structures  
3. **Class 3**: Evolution leads to chaotic, seemingly random patterns
4. **Class 4**: Complex, interesting behavior with local structures

## Implications

The classification of cellular automata behavior provides a framework for understanding complexity in computational systems and potentially in nature itself.
