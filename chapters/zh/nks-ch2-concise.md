## CHAPTER 2: The Crucial Experiment

### How Do Simple Programs Behave?

The core idea of the new science presented in this book emerged from experiments with simple, arbitrarily chosen programs, rather than those designed for specific tasks. By running these programs, particularly a class called cellular automata, I investigated their typical behavior. Cellular automata consist of a line of cells, each colored black or white, where the color of a cell at each step is determined by a simple rule based on its own color and those of its immediate neighbors.

Initial experiments with simple rules yielded simple patterns, such as uniform growth or a repeating checkerboard design. However, a slight modification to the rules led to a surprising discovery: a simple rule could produce a highly intricate and complex pattern. One such rule, rule 90, generated a nested, fractal-like structure, demonstrating that simple rules can lead to behavior that is not immediately simple.

An even more striking discovery came from rule 30, which, despite its simple definition, produces a pattern that appears extremely irregular and complex, showing almost no overall regularity. This phenomenon, where simple rules and initial conditions lead to highly complex behavior, is a central theme of this book and suggests a new explanation for the complexity seen in nature. Further experiments with rule 110 revealed a mixture of regularity and irregularity, with localized structures whose interactions are incredibly difficult to predict, reinforcing the idea that simple programs can generate profound complexity.

### The Need for a New Intuition

The discovery that simple rules can produce complex behavior challenges our everyday intuition, which is largely shaped by engineering and building things. In these fields, complex designs are typically required to achieve complex outcomes, but nature is not bound by such constraints. Our intuition fails because we are not accustomed to seeing the underlying rules of natural systems.

While practical computing offers a hint of this phenomenon—simple machine instructions combining to perform complex tasks—it usually involves complex programs. Cellular automata, however, show that both the rules and the initial conditions can be simple, yet still produce immense complexity. This requires developing a new intuition, which can only be built by exposing ourselves to many examples of these simple programs and observing their behavior.

### Why These Discoveries Were Not Made Before

The fact that such a fundamental discovery was not made earlier can be attributed to several factors. The necessary technology, particularly computers, was not widely available for the kind of exploratory experiments required. Furthermore, traditional scientific and mathematical intuition gave no reason to believe that simple programs would yield interesting results.

Historically, science has relied on mathematical equations, which are well-suited for describing simple, regular phenomena but struggle with complexity. Even with the advent of computers, research was constrained by the high cost of computer time and a focus on established mathematical models. It was not until the 1980s, when computer technology became more accessible, that systematic experiments on simple programs became feasible.

Even then, a new kind of intuition, derived from practical computing, was necessary to appreciate the significance of the complex behavior that emerged. While there were many close calls and hints of this phenomenon throughout history—in mathematics, art, and early computing—the lack of a proper framework meant that these observations were often dismissed as mere curiosities. It was the combination of powerful computational tools and a willingness to explore beyond traditional scientific methods that finally brought these discoveries to light.
