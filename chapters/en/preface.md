# Preface

Author: [Stephen Wolfram](annotation:stephen-wolfram)

More than twenty years ago, I accidentally made a seemingly trivial discovery: During a computer experiment, I saw some completely unexpected results. As I studied more, I came to realize that it was actually a tiny crack in the foundation of the existing scientific edifice—the first clue to a completely new kind of science.

This book is the culmination of my hard work and efforts over the past twenty years in developing this new science. I never expected it to take so long, but I discovered so much more than I ever imagined. Today, this system touches almost every existing field of science and even surpasses them in some respects.

At first, I followed the usual academic path and published my research results in various journals. But gradually I found that scattered technical papers could not carry the grand and brand-new ideological system I was building. So, I made a decision: work silently until the entire idea is completed, and then present it in a unified and coherent way. Fifteen years later, this book is now available to the world as the final product. I hope to share my findings and reflections with as many scientists and non-scientists as possible.

In modern times, it is almost unheard of to present truly new science for the first time in a book intended for the general public. The norm in science is to move forward in small steps, and understanding these advances often requires relying on the expertise accumulated by previous generations. But in developing this new science, I had no choice but to take it a few big steps at a time. Many times, I had to overturn existing ideas, start from scratch, and rebuild with new methods and concepts.

Maybe it would be easier if I put it in some new technical form. But I ultimately chose a different, more difficult path: trying to make the problem clear enough that it could be presented entirely in ordinary language and intuitive images.

I also understand that this book is destined to cause some people - especially those from established scientific fields - to assert at the first opportunity that their existing body of knowledge already covers everything in this book. Some people may even stop and stop going deeper. But I still hope that more people will at least read far enough to begin to be surprised and shocked by what this book is really about.

At first, perhaps many people will feel that the conclusions in the book "cannot be correct" - because they are incompatible with existing science. In fact, if I were to pick up this book for the first time today, without having thought about it for the past twenty years, I would be equally skeptical of many of the things it says.

However, the computer experiments on which this book relies can be easily verified on any modern computer. And most of the arguments in the book—although not conceptually simple—require little or no professional scientific training to understand.

It took me many years myself to finally accept these conclusions. While I try my best in my writing to make them more accessible to others, I don't expect this to be a quick process. Really absorbing the ideas expressed in this book requires a major shift in intuition and thinking.

The most important first step is to understand what this book is about. Because although it has many connections to existing knowledge, ultimately it is a completely new system of thought. It must be understood in its own language and cannot reasonably be fit into any existing framework.

Condensing twenty years of discovery into one book is a huge challenge. Often I have to condense the essence of a chapter or even a book into a page or even a paragraph. In the approximately 250,000 words of the main text, I focus on presenting the core of my thoughts and discoveries, and briefly outline the path I took to reach these conclusions. In the subsequent more than 300 pages of notes, also about 250,000 words, I added a lot of historical and technical details, and recorded more discoveries. The notes starting on page 849 also discuss a number of specific questions you may encounter while reading this book.

Throughout the book, my focus has always been on basic science and fundamental questions. But based on the methods in this book, a large number of applications can already be derived - both theoretically and practically. Some applications will emerge quickly, others may take decades to emerge. As time goes by, I believe that the ideas in this book will not only penetrate science and technology, but also expand into the general way of thinking of human beings. Eventually, its methods may become as standard a part of the education system as mathematics is today. By then, many of the ideas in the book that seem incredible today will become commonplace.

But for me personally, the most important thing has always been the process of discovery itself. Because in my experience, there is nothing more thrilling and ecstatic than the moment you first glimpse a new fundamental truth. Now, when I finally complete the construction of the ideological system described in this book, I hope that everyone who reads these words can share the excitement and joy I felt when participating in these discoveries.
