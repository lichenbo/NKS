We have exhausted human intelligence to establish [Complex Equations](annotation:complex-equations) that can explain the order of the universe.

[Stephen Wolfram](annotation:stephen-wolfram)'s "A New Science" goes straight to the origin of existence: the absolutely original set of [generative-rules](annotation:generative-rules). It rigorously reveals that when these rules are driven in the initial state, an evolutionary chain of [Determinism](annotation:determinism) will inevitably unfold.

In the evolution of this chain, infinite [complexity](annotation:complexity) is revealed. How matter takes shape, how life emerges (annotation:emergence), and how intelligence starts on its own - are all given a clear generation path in this process, showing themselves as a logical necessity derived from rules.

These complex processes spontaneously generated by simple rules, and their inherent computational capabilities are ultimately equivalent to the highest level of "[universal calculation](annotation:computational-equivalence)". Its own evolution is the only path to its future, which is the core principle of "[Computational Irreducibility](annotation:computational-irreducibility)".

This is the final statement of "A New Science": the essence of the universe is a dynamic process of becoming. It is driven by the simplest rules, unfolds in an irreducible chain, and endlessly emerges (annotation:emergence) of all complex "existences" - mathematics, matter, life, and intelligence.

# User guide for this site

üößTo prepare for the upcoming [Seattle Cultural Salon Book Club](annotation:seattle-book-club), this website is under construction and is currently updated to Chapter 12üöß

*Welcome to the interactive reading platform "A New Science"! This guide will help you get the most out of your website's features. The content of this site is jointly created by Claude Code, Gemini and ChatGPT. It is generated collaboratively by multi-source models and manually reviewed. It aims to take into account both academic quality and readability, and provide readers with a more comprehensive interactive reading experience. *

## üìñ Reading suggestions

1. **Getting Started**: Start with the [Conway Game of Life](annotation:conways-game-of-life) demonstration on the left to intuitively experience complexity science
2. **Systematic Learning**: Read in chapter order and use notes to understand the concepts in depth. Most of the comments are generated by AI, and some places are a little wordy. If you can intuitively understand the concepts, you can skip the comments and read the text directly. If you are short of time, you can read Chapters 1-3 and 11-12 first.
3. **Interactive Exploration**: Use Wolfram Rule Explorer to verify the theory in the book
4. **Intelligent Assistance**: When you have questions, ask [NKS Assistant](annotation:nks-assisstant) in the lower right corner at any time.


## üåç Language switch

The website supports three languages. Click the language button in the upper right corner to switch: (Currently, the non-Chinese language version has not been synchronized to the latest, please use the Chinese version)
- **‰∏≠Êñá** - Chinese version (default)
- **EN** - English version
- **Japanese** - Japanese version

## Equipment and interface experience

This site adopts responsive design and supports multi-end browsing on mobile phones, tablets and desktops. The interface will adapt its layout and interaction methods according to the screen size. However, in order to take into account the full functionality of the visual display and interactive tools, it is recommended to use the PC web client with a larger screen size for the best experience.

## üÜò Get help

For technical support or feedback, please visit:
- GitHub project page: submit issues or suggestions
- Use the NKS assistant in the lower right corner of the page: directly ask questions related to books (use Google BigQuery as the RAG vector database, GPT-5-nano to generate answers, and a total of 25M Tokens can be generated after recharging $10)
