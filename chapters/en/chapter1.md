# [Chapter 1: The Foundations of the New Science](annotation:chapter1)

 ## Overview of Fundamental Concepts

 Three centuries ago, science was born from the novel perspective of "describing nature using **mathematical equations**." My purpose in writing this book is to pioneer another revolution—to introduce an entirely new science whose laws are so universal they can be expressed on any computer.

 It took me twenty years to build the necessary framework, yet I remain astonished by the results: breakthroughs in this new science have solved many problems beyond the reach of traditional approaches. While the scientific community once placed unwavering faith in the reliability of mathematical equations, I discovered that nature does not adhere solely to this set of rules. Only with the advent of computers could we begin to envision more universal principles.

 Eighteen years ago, I conducted an extremely simple experiment: I ran a series of **simple programs** to see what would happen. The results were completely counterintuitive—the simplest programs often produced the most **complex behavior**. It took me over a decade to grasp its significance: this is one of the most important discoveries in the history of theoretical science. It not only opened up new fields but also demanded that we rethink nature and science itself.

 It answers an age-old question: Why does nature effortlessly generate such complex phenomena? Because natural systems behave like programs—their inherent operation is complex. Human-made creations appear simple only because we deliberately select programs that yield straightforward outcomes.

 Existing science avoids the problem of **complexity**, succeeding only in simple motions. Yet it consistently falls short in addressing many core puzzles in biology and physics. Within the framework of simple programs, however, these mysteries find resolution. More importantly, complex behavior often proves independent of underlying details, suggesting that both nature and programs follow certain shared principles.

 Thus, I propose the [Principle of Computational Equivalence](annotation:computational-equivalence): Whenever behavior ceases to be simple, its computational complexity becomes equivalent. This explains why simple programs can exhibit phenomena we perceive as profoundly complex. It also implies that many systems are [computationally irreducible](annotation:computational-irreducibility)—they cannot be deduced through formulas, but only through step-by-step computation.

 This reveals a fundamental limitation of science and offers a new understanding of "freedom": even when following basic rules, the irreducibility of complex computation grants genuine freedom. Furthermore, it demonstrates a deepest equivalence between humans, natural systems, and simple programs—this is precisely the power of the new science.

 ## Relationship with Other Fields

 ### Mathematics
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Mathematical methods once brought glory to physics, yet they still fail to explain many phenomena; conversely, extremely simple programs reveal the potential to uncover the fundamental mechanisms of the universe.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
It is commonly believed that mathematics focuses on the study of arbitrary, general abstract systems. However, this book demonstrates that there actually exist numerous abstract systems based on **simple programs**, systems that **traditional mathematics** has never considered. Moreover, because these systems are structurally **simpler** than most traditional mathematical systems in many respects, they can in fact be studied more profoundly using appropriate methods.

 Some discoveries provide unprecedentedly clear examples of phenomena already known in modern mathematics. Yet others reveal striking new phenomena. Most immediately apparent is that many systems exhibit remarkably high levels of **complexity**, despite having **underlying rules** far simpler than those in most systems found in standard mathematics textbooks.

 One consequence of this complexity is that it imposes fundamental limitations on the concept of **proof**, which has long been central to traditional mathematics. As early as the 1930s, [Gödel's Theorems](annotation:godel-theorem) hinted at such limitations. Yet in the past, these limitations seemed largely irrelevant to most practical applications of mathematics. The discoveries in this book, however, reveal that this largely reflects how narrowly the scope of mathematics is currently perceived. Indeed, the core of this work can be seen as introducing a major generalization of mathematics—accompanied by new ideas and methods, and vast new frontiers awaiting exploration.

 The framework I develop in this book also demonstrates that by fundamentally viewing mathematical processes as **computations**, it is possible to address significant questions concerning even the foundations of existing mathematics.

 ### Physics
<div class="content-layer simplified">
The discovery of simple processes provides a direct explanation for how thermodynamic behavior arises in physics, resolving a century-old puzzle. Simple processes capture the fundamental mechanisms behind physical phenomena once deemed mysterious, contrasting with traditional approaches reliant on continuous numbers and calculus. This work offers a serious possibility for finding the true foundational theory of the universe.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Historically, traditional mathematical methods have achieved tremendous success in physics, to the point where it is now almost assumed that any rigorous physical theory must be based on mathematical formulas. Yet even using these methods, some phenomena in physics remain difficult to explain. However, through the perspective of simple programs presented in this book, it seems we may finally achieve some dramatic progress. Indeed, throughout this book, we will observe how extremely simple procedures can capture the fundamental mechanisms behind physical phenomena that once seemed utterly mysterious.

 Current approaches in theoretical physics tend toward continuous numbers, computational concepts, and sometimes randomness. In contrast, most systems discussed in this book revolve around simple, independent units governed by definite rules. In every respect, this more rudimentary structure may ultimately reveal more fundamental new phenomena.

 Typically, physical models are idealized, capturing certain features while ignoring others. Historically, the most common approach has been to focus on simple numerical relationships, such as smooth surfaces. However, the new models presented in this book can capture more complex features that are only observable in behavioral patterns.

 The ultimate triumph of physics undoubtedly lies in discovering the fundamental truths of the universe. Despite occasional optimism, traditional approaches have not yielded these truths readily. However, with the methods and insights presented in this book, I firmly believe there is a significant possibility of uncovering this theory.

 ### Biology
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Biology has accumulated vast details yet lacks a universal theory. Classical biology rests on natural selection, but mathematical models struggle to capture life's complexity. The simple procedures discovered in this book generate highly complex phenomena and even replicate organismal traits, suggesting we might establish new, broad models. These could not only reveal life's mechanisms but also serve medicine, providing a fresh abstract theoretical foundation for life.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Today, vast details of biological organisms are known, yet they rarely appear in general theories. Classical biology tends to regard natural selection as the cornerstone of evolution, leading to the concept that the study and analysis of life systems should be based on their evolutionary history rather than abstract theories. One reason is that traditional mathematical models cannot approach the complexity we observe in biology. However, the simple procedures discovered in this book generate high complexity. These procedures can reproduce characteristics of some organisms—for instance, through fundamental mechanisms, genetic programs can produce actual biological forms we can observe. This suggests the potential for new, broad models of biological systems that might mimic the essence of their operations for medical purposes. Moreover, in this context, simple procedures may contain general principles applicable to biological organisms, making the establishment of new abstract theories possible.

 ### Social Sciences
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Social sciences like economics and psychology often rely on physics' mathematical paradigms, but I believe a new science based on simple programs is more likely to reveal their fundamental mechanisms and spark numerous applications. It can explain many mysterious phenomena, yet also reveals fundamental limitations in the scientific method. While a new universal theory is possible, it still requires time to break free from dependence on case-specific details.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
From economics to psychology, a widely contested assumption persists: physics' success is unquestionable, its robust theories invariably framed by sequences of numbers, equations, and classical mathematics. Yet I contend that employing this book's new science—grounded in simple programs—holds greater promise for capturing the fundamental mechanisms of social phenomena. Undoubtedly, numerous demands will swiftly emerge to apply my ideas within the social sciences. Indeed, the novel insights presented here can explain phenomena that previously seemed quite mysterious. Yet the book's conclusions point to fundamental limitations that inevitably arise when applying scientific methods. This raises new questions, but resolving them will require time—especially when people inevitably overemphasize specific case details, even as general theories become possible.

 ### Computer Science
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Traditional computer science often focuses on complex structures for specific tasks, yet frequently yields simple results. This book emphasizes that the simplest structures can also produce complex behavior, thereby offering new insights into the nature of computation. This not only expands the application of computational theory in nature and mathematics but also provides fresh perspectives on problems within computer science itself, particularly concerning the fundamental resource requirements for general computational tasks.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Throughout its brief history, computer science has almost exclusively studied specific tasks performed on specific machines. Yet this book's core argument considers general scientific problems inherent to any computer. What I discovered, however, may differ from what those grounded in existing computer science might expect. Traditional computer science research tends toward highly complex structures yielding relatively simple results—sufficient for their specific purposes. This book demonstrates that even simple structures can produce complex outcomes, and that approaching computational problems through this lens can yield fresh insights into the nature of computation itself.

 One consequence is a dramatic expansion of the domains where computational theory applies, particularly encompassing a range of fundamental questions about nature and mathematics. Another consequence is a fresh perspective on existing problems in computer science, especially concerning the fundamental resources required for general types of computational tasks.

 ### Philosophy
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Since ancient times, people have used philosophy to explore the role of the universe and humanity, but science often provides a clearer context. I believe the new science presented in this book will address these fundamental questions: the limits of knowledge, free will, the uniqueness of humanity, and the necessity of mathematics. Traditional intuitions have long constrained our understanding, yet these discoveries can guide new intuitions, leading to solutions that differ from what philosophy might predict.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Throughout history, certain questions about the universe and our role within it have seemed accessible only through philosophy's general arguments. Yet scientific progress often ultimately provides a clearer context. I believe the new science presented in this book will do just that for questions long considered fundamental. These include the ultimate limits of knowledge, free will, the uniqueness of the human condition, and the necessity of mathematics. Throughout the history of philosophy, much has been said about each of these questions. Yet inevitably, it has been informed only by the prevailing intuitions about how things ought to work. But my discoveries in this book lead to entirely new intuitions. With these intuitions, it turns out that one can begin to see solutions to many long-standing problems for the first time—often along lines quite different from those anticipated by traditional general philosophical arguments.

 ### Art
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Natural forms have long inspired art, while the discovery of simple algorithms reveals the fundamental mechanisms behind complex aesthetics. Despite traditional intuition suggesting they can only generate monotonous images, minimalist rules have proven capable of creating stunning beauty—sometimes mimicking nature, sometimes transcending it.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Nature seems effortlessly capable of creating profoundly beautiful forms. Yet historically, art could largely only aspire to imitate these forms. Now, however, with the discovery that simple programs can capture the fundamental mechanisms behind nature's diverse complex behaviors, it becomes conceivable to explore generalizations of the natural forms we observe simply by sampling these programs. Traditional scientific intuition—and early computational art—might suggest that simple programs invariably produce overly simplistic and rigid images lacking artistic merit. Yet a thorough reading of this book reveals that even programs governed by extremely simple rules can frequently generate images of astonishing aesthetic quality—sometimes reminiscent of nature, yet often unlike anything seen before.

 ### Technology
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Nature exhibits complexity beyond technology, yet the discoveries in this book reveal that simple programs can capture its fundamental mechanisms. This suggests the possibility of a new technology as complex as nature itself. Traditional engineering assumes complex tasks require complex rules, but the opposite is true: simple rules suffice, even down to the atomic level. I believe this will dramatically transform the foundations of technology within decades and expand humanity's capacity to harness the universe.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Despite tremendous success, nature still presents phenomena that appear more complex than anything technology can produce. The discoveries in this book demonstrate that simple rule-based programs can capture fundamental natural mechanisms, enabling us to envision a new technology capable of achieving complexity akin to nature's own. Traditional engineering experience dictates that accomplishing a complex task requires building a system with equally complex underlying rules. Yet the discoveries in this book refute this, demonstrating that only simple underlying rules are actually needed—as if implemented directly at the atomic level. While this book primarily addresses fundamental scientific questions, I suspect that within mere decades, my work will dramatically alter the foundations of technology—and our fundamental capacity to harness the universe for our purposes.

 ## Past Attempts

 ### Artificial Intelligence
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Artificial intelligence initially aimed to replicate human thought, yet stalled by the challenge of explaining how the brain's simple components generate complex reasoning. The framework proposed in this book may provide this foundation, heralding dramatic progress in human-like thinking systems built upon it.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
When electronic computers were first invented, it was widely believed they would soon be capable of human-like thinking. In the 1960s, the field of artificial intelligence emerged, aiming to understand human thought processes and replicate them on computers. However, this proved far more difficult than anticipated, yielding little fundamental progress beyond a few derivative achievements. To some extent, the core challenge has always been understanding how seemingly simple components in the brain can generate the full complexity of thought. Yet now, with the framework developed in this book, we finally possess a meaningful foundation for tackling this problem. Indeed, based on the theoretical and practical ideas presented here, I suspect it may ultimately be possible to achieve significant breakthroughs in creating technological systems capable of human-like thinking.

 ### [Artificial Life](annotation:artificial-life)
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Artificial life research once relied on complex programs to simulate biological systems, but this book demonstrates that simple programs are equally sufficient—not only can they reproduce biological traits, but they also reveal fundamental mechanisms closer to real organisms.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Since the advent of machines, people have wondered to what extent they could mimic living systems. The field of artificial life, most active from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, primarily focused on demonstrating that computer programs could be used to simulate various characteristics of biological systems. However, it was commonly assumed that the required programs must be quite complex. The findings in this book, however, indicate that remarkably simple programs are in fact sufficient. Such programs make the fundamental mechanisms of behavior clearer—and potentially closer to what actually occurs in real biological systems.

 ### [Catastrophe Theory](annotation:catastrophe-theory)
Traditional mathematical models typically rely on continuously varying quantities. Yet in nature, discrete changes are frequently observable. The catastrophe theory popular in the 1970s focused on how even within conventional mathematical frameworks, certain simple discrete shifts could still occur. In this book, I do not begin with any assumption of continuity—the types of behavior I examine are often far more complex than those addressed in catastrophe theory.

 ### [Chaos Theory](annotation:deterministic-chaos)
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Chaos theory reveals systems' extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, making them difficult to predict. Yet this sensitivity does not necessarily lead to complex behavior. This book demonstrates that even with extremely simple initial conditions, systems often generate highly complex outcomes—a key example of natural complexity.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
The field of chaos theory is founded on the discovery that a mathematical system's behavior exhibits extreme sensitivity to the specifics of its initial conditions. First noted in the 19th century, this phenomenon gained prominence with the rise of computer simulations in the 1960s and 1970s. Its primary significance lies in the implication that predicting a system's ultimate behavior becomes impossible if any detail of its initial conditions is uncertain. Yet despite some objections, this fact alone does not necessitate that behavior will inevitably become complex. Indeed, it merely states that complex behavior at large scales arises only when the initial conditions themselves are complex. Yet even with simple initial conditions, there is no reason to assume the final behavior will be equally simple. This book presents numerous examples where systems with straightforward initial conditions exhibit remarkably complex behavior. I believe this phenomenon exemplifies how complexity manifests in nature.

 ### [Complexity Theory](annotation:complexity)

 <div class="content-layer simplified">
Past complexity research has been fragmented and limited; this book systematically studies complexity as a universal phenomenon based on general simple programs, providing a fundamental framework for understanding its origins.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
My discoveries in the early 1980s led me to believe that complexity could be studied as a fundamental independent phenomenon, and this perspective gradually gained popularity. However, most research based on my early findings concluded, largely absorbed into existing scientific frameworks, achieving only incremental progress on any general or foundational questions. A defining feature of the new science presented in this book is that it finally enables the development of a fundamental understanding of the complexity of general phenomena and its origins.

 ### [Computational Complexity Theory](annotation:computational-complexity)

 Developed since the 1970s, computational complexity theory seeks to describe the difficulty of computational tasks. Its specific results often rely on concrete programs with complex structures, even when their behavior is simple. The new science presented in this book develops more general types of programs, offering fresh insights into long-standing problems in computational complexity theory.


 ### [Cybernetics](annotation:cybernetics)

 In the 1940s, it was proposed that biological systems could be understood through analogies to electrical circuits. However, fundamentally, the only available analytical tools came from traditional mathematics, and typical complex biological behaviors were rarely successfully captured.


 ### [Dynamical Systems Theory](annotation:dynamical-systems)

 <div class="content-layer simplified">
Equation-based approaches to dynamical systems are often too restrictive; the actual behavior of many systems is too complex to be effectively captured by them.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
As a branch of mathematics developed roughly a century ago, the field of dynamical systems theory focuses on studying systems that evolve over time through specific mathematical equations, using traditional geometry and other mathematical methods to describe the forms of behavior they may exhibit. However, this book argues that the behavior of these systems is, in fact, inherently too complex to be effectively captured by this approach.

 ### Evolutionary Theory

 <div class="content-layer simplified">
Darwinian selection alone cannot explain the origin of complexity and often even contradicts it; this book proposes a novel mechanism that better accounts for complex forms in living organisms.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is commonly invoked to explain the complexity we observe in biological systems, and indeed in recent years this theory has been applied beyond biology. Yet a persistent question remains: why does this theory seem to imply the emergence of complexity? Indeed, as I will discuss in this book, it often appears to run counter to complexity. However, a novel and entirely different mechanism discovered in this work offers, I believe, a compelling explanation for many complex phenomena observed in the biological world.

 ### Experimental Mathematics

 <div class="content-layer simplified">
Experimental mathematics often verifies existing problems; this book centers on computational experiments to explore more general systems, extending beyond the scope of existing mathematics.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
The idea of exploring mathematical systems through computed data has a long history, gaining widespread traction with the advent of computers and Mathematica (Note: a mathematical software developed by the author). However, without exception, it has historically been confined to studying problems and systems already investigated by other mathematical methods—a common practice within the mathematical tradition. The approach I present in this book employs computational experiments as a fundamental method to explore more general systems. This represents a departure from traditional mathematics and is often beyond the grasp of existing mathematical methods.

 ### [Fractal Geometry](annotation:fractals) 
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Fractals emphasize nested complex shapes, but this book also demonstrates numerous more intricate, non-nested form-generation mechanisms.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Until recently, the only shape types widely discussed in science and mathematics were those that were regular or smooth. But beginning in the late 1970s, the field of fractal geometry emphasized the importance of nested shapes containing arbitrarily complex parts, arguing that such shapes are common in nature. In this book, we will encounter a considerable number of systems that generate these nested shapes. But we will also discover many systems that produce more complex shapes without nested structures.

 ### General Systems Theory

 General systems theory, which gained particular popularity in the 1960s, primarily focused on studying large-scale primitive networks—typically idealized human organizations. However, without the various methodologies presented in this book, it is nearly impossible to draw precise conclusions.


 ### Nanotechnology

 Nanotechnology, which has developed rapidly since the early 1990s, aims to realize technical systems at the atomic scale. However, its focus has so far narrowed to familiar mechanical and other devices. The systems presented in this book exhibit complex behavior despite their simple structures, and some are particularly well-suited for direct implementation at the atomic scale in certain aspects.


 ### Nonlinear Dynamics

 Linear mathematical equations are typically straightforward to solve and are widely applied in science. The field of nonlinear dynamics focuses on analyzing more complex equations. Among these, the most successful are soliton equations, which, through careful manipulation, can exhibit linear-like properties. However, the systems discussed in this book often display complex behavior and lack such simplifying properties.


 ### Scientific Computing

 The field of scientific computing typically focuses on employing traditional mathematical models—often applied to various fluids and solids—and attempts to implement them numerically on computers. Generally, it is challenging to distinguish complex phenomena from the effects of using approximations. Several models I propose in this book do not rely on approximate implementations, yet they readily reveal more intricate phenomena.

 ### [Self-organization](annotation:self-organization)

 <div class="content-layer simplified">
Self-organization research has largely been confined to simple structures; using the framework presented in this book, we can explain how large-scale complex structures spontaneously emerge.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
In nature, we often observe systems that begin as chaotic and featureless, yet subsequently organize themselves spontaneously into specific structures. The loose field of self-organization typically focuses on understanding this phenomenon. However, most approaches rely on traditional mathematical models, limiting their scope to relatively simple structures. The perspectives presented in this book enable us to comprehend how such vast, complex structures emerge.

 ### Statistical Mechanics

 <div class="content-layer simplified">
Statistical mechanics masks individual complexity with averages and relies on the [second law of thermodynamics], whose foundational validity has long been questioned. This book presents a new computational framework that may clarify its underlying principles.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Developed over a century ago, statistical mechanics is a branch of physics concerned with understanding the average behavior of systems composed of large numbers of gas molecules and other particles. For any specific instance, such a system exhibits complexity. However, by focusing on the average across a large number of instances, statistical mechanics typically avoids this complexity. To connect with reality, it frequently employs the so-called Second Law of Thermodynamics, or the [entropy increase principle](annotation:second-law-thermodynamics). Yet over a century of reliance on this principle has revealed persistent difficulties in its interpretation. By adopting the ideas presented in this book, I believe a framework emerges that can resolve these issues.

 ## Personal Stories of Science in This Book

 <div class="content-layer simplified">
My fascination with these scientific questions began in 1972. At twelve years old, I was intrigued by an illustration of a random process on the cover of a physics textbook and attempted to simulate it on a computer. I discovered that the simple system I constructed was actually a special case of a cellular automaton. Had I not pursued realism, I might have uncovered the core phenomena in this book as early as 1974.

 Later, I immersed myself in theoretical particle physics and made progress, yet gradually grew skeptical that many fundamental questions depended on the field's intricate details. Shifting focus to everyday complexity in nature, I found traditional mathematics largely inadequate. Inspired by my experience developing symbolic languages and software systems, I resolved to start with the simplest models.

 In the summer of 1981, I conducted an extremely simple computer experiment that surprisingly revealed complex behavior. This unexpected outcome prompted me to gradually understand and ultimately establish the new scientific framework presented in this book.
</div>

 <div class="content-layer detailed">
I can trace the origins of my deep fascination with the scientific questions discussed in this book quite precisely to the summer of 1972, when I was twelve years old. I purchased a copy of the physics textbook shown on the right and became intensely curious about the randomization process illustrated on its cover. However, since I found the mathematical explanation provided in the book far from convincing, I decided to attempt simulating the process myself on a computer.

 The computer I had access to at the time was extremely primitive by modern standards. Consequently, I had no choice but to study a highly simplified version of the process described in the book. From the outset, I suspected the system I built might be too simplistic to display any of the phenomena I desired. After considerable programming effort, I managed to convince myself that these suspicions were correct.

 However, it turned out that what I was studying was a special case of one of the main classes of systems I consider in this book—[cellular automata](annotation:cellular-automata). Had it not been for a largely technical issue stemming from my desire for my simulations to be as physically realistic as possible, I likely would have discovered some of the major phenomena I now describe in this book as early as 1974.

 Nevertheless, I chose to focus my energy on what seemed then the most fundamental realm of science: theoretical [particle physics](annotation:particle-physics). Over the next few years, I did make significant advances in certain areas of particle physics and cosmology. But after a while, I began to suspect that many of the most important and fundamental problems I encountered were quite independent of the intricate details within these fields.

 In fact, I realized that even many pertinent questions about everyday, ubiquitous phenomena remained entirely unanswered. For example, what is the fundamental origin of the intricate patterns observed in turbulence? How are the complex patterns of snowflakes generated? What are the basic mechanisms that allow plants and animals to grow in such intricate ways?

 What astonished me was how little research seemed to exist on these questions. At first, I thought progress might be possible simply by applying some of the complex mathematical techniques I had used in theoretical physics. But it soon became clear that for the phenomena I was studying, traditional mathematical results would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to find.

 So what could I do? As it happened, as a byproduct of my work in physics, I had just completed the development of a large software system in 1981 that in some respects was a precursor to some of Mathematica's capabilities. At least intellectually, the most difficult part of this project was designing the symbolic language upon which the system was based. But in the process of developing this language, I saw quite clearly how the few primitive operations I had devised ultimately succeeded in covering a vast array of complex computational tasks.

 So I thought, perhaps I could do something similar in the natural sciences: there might be some suitable primitive elements that I could discover, thereby successfully capturing a vast array of natural phenomena. My thinking wasn't as clear back then, but I believe I implicitly envisioned that this approach would work by using these primitive elements to construct computer programs simulating the various natural systems that interested me.

 In many cases, well-developed mathematical models exist for the individual components of these systems. However, using these as the basis for simulation presents two practical problems. First, these models are often quite complex, making it difficult to include enough components to produce interesting phenomena within realistic computational resources. Second, even when such phenomena are observed, it is nearly impossible to determine whether they are genuine consequences of the underlying model or merely the result of approximations made when implementing the model on a computer.

 But I realized that for many of the phenomena I wished to study, employing the most precise individual component models was not critical. Among other reasons, evidence from nature suggests that in many cases, the details of components are unimportant—thus, for example, the same complex flow patterns emerge in both air and water. With this in mind, I decided that rather than starting with detailed realistic models, I would begin with models as simple as possible—and easily programmable on a computer.

 At first, I had no idea how this would work or how complex the program I needed would become. Indeed, when I studied various simple programs, they always seemed to produce behavior far simpler than any system I wanted to investigate.

 But in the summer of 1981, I conducted what I thought was a fairly straightforward computer experiment to observe the behavior of all programs of a specific type. I didn't have high expectations for this experiment. Yet the results were so astonishing and compelling that, as I gradually understood them, they forced me to rethink my entire view of science and ultimately led to the development of the entire body of knowledge I now describe in this book.

 The image on the right shows a reproduction of typical output from my original experiment. The graphics are primitive, yet the intricate patterns they contain were unlike anything I had ever seen before. At first, I couldn't believe they could be correct. But after some time, I became convinced they were—I realized I was witnessing signs of a remarkably significant and unexpected phenomenon: even very simple programs could exhibit behavior of immense complexity.

 But how could something so fundamental have gone unnoticed? I scoured the scientific literature and spoke with many people, discovering that systems similar to the one I was studying had been named "cellular automata" thirty years prior. Yet despite several close attempts, no one had actually conducted the kind of experiment I did.

 Nevertheless, I remained skeptical that the fundamental phenomenon I observed must be the obvious outcome of some known scientific principle. While I did find that ideas from fields like chaos theory and fractal geometry helped explain certain specific features, it seemed that nothing approaching the entire phenomenon had ever been studied.

 My early discoveries about the behavior of [cellular automata](annotation:cellular-automata) sparked considerable activity within the scientific community. By the mid-1980s, numerous applications had been discovered in physics, biology, computer science, mathematics, and other fields. Indeed, some of the phenomena I had uncovered began to serve as the foundation for what I termed a new field of research: the theory of complex systems.

 Yet throughout all this, I continued exploring more fundamental questions. By around 1985, I began to realize that what I had previously observed was merely the tip of a far more dramatic and fundamental iceberg. However, grasping what I was uncovering proved difficult and required a significant shift in intuition.

 Nevertheless, I could see extraordinary opportunities for knowledge ahead. My first thought was to try organizing academia to seize them. So I founded a research center and a journal, published a list of problems to tackle, and worked to convey the importance of the direction I was defining.

 Yet despite growing excitement—especially about potential applications—little seemed to shift away from traditional methods and intuition. After some time, I realized that any significant progress would have to come from me. So I resolved to build the best tools and infrastructure I could access, then pursue the research I believed needed doing as efficiently as possible—myself.

 In the early 1980s, my biggest obstacle was the sheer difficulty of conducting computer experiments using the various, rather primitive tools available at the time. But by 1986, I realized that with some new ideas, it might be possible to build a single, coherent system for handling a wide range of technical computations. Since nothing like it seemed to exist, I decided to build it myself.

 The result was Mathematica.

 For five years, building Mathematica and its surrounding companies consumed me. But in 1991—no longer an academic, but the CEO of a successful company—I was able to return to researching the various problems covered in this book.

 Armed with Mathematica, I began attempting all sorts of new experiments. The results were astonishing—in a matter of months, I had made more new discoveries with my simple programs than in the previous decade combined. My earlier work had shown me the beginnings of some unexpected and highly significant phenomena. But now, from my new experiments, I began to see the full power and universality of these phenomena.

 As my methodology and intuition improved, my discovery rate accelerated. Within just a few years, I had advanced my exploration of the world of simple programs to a point where the sheer volume of factual information I had accumulated would be the envy of many long-established scientific fields.

 Early in the process, I began to formulate several fairly general principles. The further I progressed, the more these principles were validated, and the more I realized how powerful and universal they were.

 When I began in the early 1980s, my primary goal was to understand complex phenomena. But by the mid-1990s, I had built a complete knowledge structure capable of doing much more—indeed, one that laid the foundation for what can only be considered a fundamentally new science.

 This was the most thrilling period for me. Every direction I turned revealed vast, untouched new domains I could explore for the first time. Each possessed its own unique characteristics. Yet through the holistic framework I developed, I gradually found answers to nearly all the most obvious questions I had posed.

 Initially, I focused primarily on new questions that had never been central to any existing scientific field. But gradually, I realized that the new science I was constructing should also offer a fundamentally new approach to solving the basic problems within existing fields.

 Therefore, around 1994, I began systematically studying the major traditional scientific fields. I had long been interested in the fundamental problems within many of these fields. Yet I generally tended to accept most of the conventional wisdom about them. However, as I began examining them within the context of my new science, I continually encountered indications that a significant portion of this conventional wisdom might be incorrect.

 A typical problem is that there exist core issues which traditional approaches or intuition have never successfully resolved—and which the field has somehow learned to avoid. Yet time and again, I was thrilled to discover that with my new science, I could suddenly make tremendous progress—even on problems that had remained unanswered for centuries in some cases.

 Given the entire framework I've established, much of what I discover ultimately appears remarkably simple. Yet reaching these insights typically demands extensive scientific labor. Merely knowing a few specific technical steps is insufficient. Instead, in each domain, it's necessary to develop sufficiently broad and deep understanding to identify truly essential characteristics—which can then be reimagined based on my new science.

 This approach naturally requires experience across diverse scientific domains. But perhaps most crucially for me, the process resembles something I did countless times while designing Mathematica: starting with complex technical ideas and gradually seeing how their essential characteristics could be captured using extremely simple elements. My repeated successes in Mathematica gave me the confidence to attempt similar approaches across various scientific fields.

 In hindsight, it often seems almost strange that the conclusions I eventually reached had never been reached before. Yet by studying the history of each field, I could frequently see how it had been led astray by the absence of certain key methodological approaches or intuitions that now emerge in the new science I am developing.

 When I first encountered discoveries about [cellular automata](annotation:cellular-automata) in the early 1980s, I suspected I was witnessing the dawn of something significant. Yet I had no idea how profoundly important it would ultimately become. Indeed, over the past two decades, my discoveries have far exceeded my initial expectations. The new science I devoted so much effort to building now appears to be emerging as an increasingly central and pivotal direction for the future development of knowledge.
