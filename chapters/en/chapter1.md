# [Chapter 1: The Foundations of the New Science](annotation:chapter1)

 ## Overview of Fundamental Concepts

 Three centuries ago, science was born from the novel perspective of "describing nature using **mathematical equations**." My purpose in writing this book is to pioneer another revolution—to introduce an entirely new science whose laws are so universal they can be expressed on any computer.

 It took me twenty years to build the necessary framework, yet I remain astonished by the results: breakthroughs in this new science have solved many problems beyond the reach of traditional approaches. While the scientific community once placed unwavering faith in the reliability of mathematical equations, I discovered that nature does not adhere solely to this set of rules. Only with the advent of computers could we begin to envision more universal principles.

 Eighteen years ago, I conducted an extremely simple experiment: I ran a series of **simple programs** to see what would happen. The results were completely counterintuitive—the simplest programs often produced the most **complex behavior**. It took me over a decade to grasp its significance: this is one of the most important discoveries in the history of theoretical science. It not only opened up new fields but also demanded that we rethink nature and science itself.

 It answers an age-old question: Why does nature effortlessly generate such complex phenomena? Because natural systems behave like programs—their inherent operation is complex. Human-made creations appear simple only because we deliberately select programs that yield straightforward outcomes.

 Existing science avoids the problem of **complexity**, succeeding only in simple motions. Yet it consistently falls short in addressing many core puzzles in biology and physics. Within the framework of simple programs, however, these mysteries find resolution. More importantly, complex behavior often proves independent of underlying details, suggesting that both nature and programs follow certain shared principles.

 Thus, I propose the [Principle of Computational Equivalence](annotation:computational-equivalence): Whenever behavior ceases to be simple, its computational complexity becomes equivalent. This explains why simple programs can exhibit phenomena we perceive as profoundly complex. It also implies that many systems are [computationally irreducible](annotation:computational-irreducibility)—they cannot be deduced through formulas, but only through step-by-step computation.

 This reveals a fundamental limitation of science and offers a new understanding of "freedom": even when following basic rules, the irreducibility of complex computation grants genuine freedom. Furthermore, it demonstrates a deepest equivalence between humans, natural systems, and simple programs—this is precisely the power of the new science.

 ## Relationship with Other Fields

 ### Mathematics
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Mathematical methods once brought glory to physics, yet they still fail to explain many phenomena; conversely, extremely simple programs reveal the potential to uncover the fundamental mechanisms of the universe.
</div>

 ### Physics
<div class="content-layer simplified">
The discovery of simple processes provides a direct explanation for how thermodynamic behavior arises in physics, resolving a century-old puzzle. Simple processes capture the fundamental mechanisms behind physical phenomena once deemed mysterious, contrasting with traditional approaches reliant on continuous numbers and calculus. This work offers a serious possibility for finding the true foundational theory of the universe.
</div>

 ### Biology
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Biology has accumulated vast details yet lacks a universal theory. Classical biology rests on natural selection, but mathematical models struggle to capture life's complexity. The simple procedures discovered in this book generate highly complex phenomena and even replicate organismal traits, suggesting we might establish new, broad models. These could not only reveal life's mechanisms but also serve medicine, providing a fresh abstract theoretical foundation for life.
</div>

 ### Social Sciences
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Social sciences like economics and psychology often rely on physics' mathematical paradigms, but I believe a new science based on simple programs is more likely to reveal their fundamental mechanisms and spark numerous applications. It can explain many mysterious phenomena, yet also reveals fundamental limitations in the scientific method. While a new universal theory is possible, it still requires time to break free from dependence on case-specific details.
</div>

 ### Computer Science
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Traditional computer science often focuses on complex structures for specific tasks, yet frequently yields simple results. This book emphasizes that the simplest structures can also produce complex behavior, thereby offering new insights into the nature of computation. This not only expands the application of computational theory in nature and mathematics but also provides fresh perspectives on problems within computer science itself, particularly concerning the fundamental resource requirements for general computational tasks.
</div>


 ### Philosophy
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Since ancient times, people have used philosophy to explore the role of the universe and humanity, but science often provides a clearer context. I believe the new science presented in this book will address these fundamental questions: the limits of knowledge, free will, the uniqueness of humanity, and the necessity of mathematics. Traditional intuitions have long constrained our understanding, yet these discoveries can guide new intuitions, leading to solutions that differ from what philosophy might predict.
</div>

 ### Art
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Natural forms have long inspired art, while the discovery of simple algorithms reveals the fundamental mechanisms behind complex aesthetics. Despite traditional intuition suggesting they can only generate monotonous images, minimalist rules have proven capable of creating stunning beauty—sometimes mimicking nature, sometimes transcending it.
</div>


 ### Technology
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Nature exhibits complexity beyond technology, yet the discoveries in this book reveal that simple programs can capture its fundamental mechanisms. This suggests the possibility of a new technology as complex as nature itself. Traditional engineering assumes complex tasks require complex rules, but the opposite is true: simple rules suffice, even down to the atomic level. I believe this will dramatically transform the foundations of technology within decades and expand humanity's capacity to harness the universe.

 ## Past Attempts

 ### Artificial Intelligence
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Artificial intelligence initially aimed to replicate human thought, yet stalled by the challenge of explaining how the brain's simple components generate complex reasoning. The framework proposed in this book may provide this foundation, heralding dramatic progress in human-like thinking systems built upon it.
</div>


 ### [Artificial Life](annotation:artificial-life)
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Artificial life research once relied on complex programs to simulate biological systems, but this book demonstrates that simple programs are equally sufficient—not only can they reproduce biological traits, but they also reveal fundamental mechanisms closer to real organisms.
</div>


 ### [Catastrophe Theory](annotation:catastrophe-theory)
Traditional mathematical models typically rely on continuously varying quantities. Yet in nature, discrete changes are frequently observable. The catastrophe theory popular in the 1970s focused on how even within conventional mathematical frameworks, certain simple discrete shifts could still occur. In this book, I do not begin with any assumption of continuity—the types of behavior I examine are often far more complex than those addressed in catastrophe theory.

 ### [Chaos Theory](annotation:deterministic-chaos)
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Chaos theory reveals systems' extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, making them difficult to predict. Yet this sensitivity does not necessarily lead to complex behavior. This book demonstrates that even with extremely simple initial conditions, systems often generate highly complex outcomes—a key example of natural complexity.
</div>


 ### [Complexity Theory](annotation:complexity)

 <div class="content-layer simplified">
Past complexity research has been fragmented and limited; this book systematically studies complexity as a universal phenomenon based on general simple programs, providing a fundamental framework for understanding its origins.
</div>


 ### [Computational Complexity Theory](annotation:computational-complexity)

 Developed since the 1970s, computational complexity theory seeks to describe the difficulty of computational tasks. Its specific results often rely on concrete programs with complex structures, even when their behavior is simple. The new science presented in this book develops more general types of programs, offering fresh insights into long-standing problems in computational complexity theory.


 ### [Cybernetics](annotation:cybernetics)

 In the 1940s, it was proposed that biological systems could be understood through analogies to electrical circuits. However, fundamentally, the only available analytical tools came from traditional mathematics, and typical complex biological behaviors were rarely successfully captured.


 ### [Dynamical Systems Theory](annotation:dynamical-systems)

 <div class="content-layer simplified">
Equation-based approaches to dynamical systems are often too restrictive; the actual behavior of many systems is too complex to be effectively captured by them.
</div>


 ### Evolutionary Theory

 <div class="content-layer simplified">
Darwinian selection alone cannot explain the origin of complexity and often even contradicts it; this book proposes a novel mechanism that better accounts for complex forms in living organisms.
</div>


 ### Experimental Mathematics

 <div class="content-layer simplified">
Experimental mathematics often verifies existing problems; this book centers on computational experiments to explore more general systems, extending beyond the scope of existing mathematics.
</div>


 ### [Fractal Geometry](annotation:fractals) 
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Fractals emphasize nested complex shapes, but this book also demonstrates numerous more intricate, non-nested form-generation mechanisms.
</div>


 ### General Systems Theory

 General systems theory, which gained particular popularity in the 1960s, primarily focused on studying large-scale primitive networks—typically idealized human organizations. However, without the various methodologies presented in this book, it is nearly impossible to draw precise conclusions.


 ### Nanotechnology

 Nanotechnology, which has developed rapidly since the early 1990s, aims to realize technical systems at the atomic scale. However, its focus has so far narrowed to familiar mechanical and other devices. The systems presented in this book exhibit complex behavior despite their simple structures, and some are particularly well-suited for direct implementation at the atomic scale in certain aspects.


 ### Nonlinear Dynamics

 Linear mathematical equations are typically straightforward to solve and are widely applied in science. The field of nonlinear dynamics focuses on analyzing more complex equations. Among these, the most successful are soliton equations, which, through careful manipulation, can exhibit linear-like properties. However, the systems discussed in this book often display complex behavior and lack such simplifying properties.


 ### Scientific Computing

 The field of scientific computing typically focuses on employing traditional mathematical models—often applied to various fluids and solids—and attempts to implement them numerically on computers. Generally, it is challenging to distinguish complex phenomena from the effects of using approximations. Several models I propose in this book do not rely on approximate implementations, yet they readily reveal more intricate phenomena.

 ### [Self-organization](annotation:self-organization)

 <div class="content-layer simplified">
Self-organization research has largely been confined to simple structures; using the framework presented in this book, we can explain how large-scale complex structures spontaneously emerge.
</div>


 ### Statistical Mechanics

 <div class="content-layer simplified">
Statistical mechanics masks individual complexity with averages and relies on the [second law of thermodynamics], whose foundational validity has long been questioned. This book presents a new computational framework that may clarify its underlying principles.

 ## Personal Stories of Science in This Book

 <div class="content-layer simplified">
My fascination with these scientific questions began in 1972. At twelve years old, I was intrigued by an illustration of a random process on the cover of a physics textbook and attempted to simulate it on a computer. I discovered that the simple system I constructed was actually a special case of a cellular automaton. Had I not pursued realism, I might have uncovered the core phenomena in this book as early as 1974.

 Later, I immersed myself in theoretical particle physics and made progress, yet gradually grew skeptical that many fundamental questions depended on the field's intricate details. Shifting focus to everyday complexity in nature, I found traditional mathematics largely inadequate. Inspired by my experience developing symbolic languages and software systems, I resolved to start with the simplest models.

 In the summer of 1981, I conducted an extremely simple computer experiment that surprisingly revealed complex behavior. This unexpected outcome prompted me to gradually understand and ultimately establish the new scientific framework presented in this book.
