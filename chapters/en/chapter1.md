# [Chapter 1: Foundations of New Science](annotation:chapter1)

## Overview of basic ideas

Three centuries ago, science was born out of the new idea of ​​using **mathematical equations** to describe nature. My purpose in writing this book is to create another kind of disruption - to introduce a brand new science whose laws are so general that they can be expressed on any computer.

It took me twenty years to establish the required framework, but I was still shocked by the results: many difficult problems that were beyond the reach of traditional science have been broken through by this new science. In the past, the scientific community believed in the reliability of mathematical equations, but I discovered that nature does not only follow this set of laws. With the advent of computers, we were able to conceive of more general rules for the first time.

Eighteen years ago, I conducted an extremely simple experiment: run a series of **simple programs** and see what would happen. The results completely subvert intuition - the simplest programs often produce the most complex behaviors. It took me more than ten years to accept its significance: this is one of the most important discoveries in the history of theoretical science. It not only opens up new fields, but also requires us to rethink nature and science.

It answers an age-old question: Why can nature generate such complex phenomena so easily? Because natural systems are like programs, their natural behavior when running is complex. Human production is simple because we deliberately select programs that produce simple results.

Existing science avoids the problem of complexity and only succeeds in simple movements. But they have fallen short on many of the core mysteries of biology and physics. But within the framework of simple programs, these puzzles have solutions. What's more, complex behavior is often independent of underlying details, suggesting that both nature and programs follow certain common principles.

From this, I proposed the [Computational Equivalence](annotation:computational-equivalence): as long as the behaviors are no longer simple, their computational complexity is equivalent. This explains why simple programs can exhibit phenomena that appear to us to be extremely complex. It also means that many systems are [Computational Irreducibility](annotation:computational-irreducibility) and cannot be deduced using formulas. The only way is to perform step-by-step calculations.

This reveals the fundamental limitations of science and gives us a new understanding of the meaning of "freedom": the irreducibility of complex calculations confers real freedom, even when basic rules are followed. Furthermore, it shows that there is a deepest equivalence between humans, natural systems, and simple programs—and this is where the power of the new science lies.

## Relations with other fields

### math
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Mathematical methods have brought glory to physics, but they still cannot explain many phenomena; however, extremely simple programs have shown the possibility of revealing the fundamental mechanism of the universe.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Mathematics is generally thought to be concerned with the study of arbitrary general abstract systems. But this book shows that there are actually a large number of abstract systems based on simple programs that have never been considered by traditional mathematics. And because these systems are in many ways **simpler** in construction than most traditional mathematical systems, they can actually be studied in greater depth with appropriate methods.

Some of what was discovered were unprecedentedly clear examples of phenomena known in modern mathematics. But some striking new phenomena were also discovered. What is most immediately obvious is that many systems behave with very high **complexity** and the **underlying rules** of these systems are much simpler than most systems found in standard mathematics textbooks.

One consequence of this complexity is that it leads to fundamental limitations on the concept of proof that has been central to traditional mathematics. As early as the 1930s, the [Godel Theorem](annotation:godel-theorem) gave some indication of this limitation. But in the past, they seemed irrelevant to most practical applications of mathematics. However, the findings in this book show that this largely reflects just how small the scope of what is now considered mathematics is. Indeed, the core of this book can be seen as the introduction of a major generalization of mathematics - along with new ideas and methods, and vast new areas to explore.

The framework I develop in this book also shows that it is possible to address important questions about the foundations of even existing mathematics by looking at mathematical processes in fundamentally **computational** ways.

### Physics
<div class="content-layer simplified">
The discovery of a simple program provides a direct explanation of how [Thermodynamics](annotation:thermodynamics) occurs in physics, resolving more than a century of confusion. Simple programs can capture the fundamental mechanisms of physical phenomena previously considered mysterious, in contrast to traditional methods that rely on continuous numbers and [Calculus](annotation:calculus). This book offers serious possibilities for finding the true fundamental theory of the universe.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Historically, traditional mathematical methods have been very successful in physics, and it is almost assumed that any rigorous physical theory must be based on mathematical formulas. But despite using these methods, some phenomena in physics are still difficult to explain clearly. But through the thinking method from a simple program perspective explained in this book, it seems that some dramatic progress can be achieved in the end. Indeed, over the course of this book, we will see that some extremely simple programs can capture the basic mechanisms of some physical phenomena that previously seemed completely mysterious.

Existing approaches to theoretical physics tend toward notions of continuous numbers, calculations, and sometimes randomness. Most of the systems in this book revolve around simple independent units operating under certain rules. By all accounts, this simpler structure may ultimately identify more fundamental new phenomena.

General physical models are idealized, capturing some features and ignoring others. In the past, the most common method was to determine simple numerical relationships, such as smooth surfaces. But the new models in this book are able to capture more complex features that can only be seen in images of behavior.

The triumph of physics in the future will undoubtedly be finding a fundamental truth about the universe. Despite occasional optimism, traditional approaches are not always easy to come by. But with the methods and intuition I discovered in this book, I firmly believe that it is quite possible to discover this theory.

### Biology
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Biology has accumulated a wealth of details but a lack of general theories. Classical biology is based on natural selection, but mathematical models cannot touch the complexity of life. The simple programs discovered in this book can generate highly complex phenomena and even reproduce the characteristics of living organisms, suggesting that we may be able to establish new and extensive models that not only reveal the mechanisms of life, but can also be used for medical treatment and provide a new abstract theoretical basis for life.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Today, a large number of biological organisms are known in detail, but few general theories exist. The field of classical biology tends to take natural selection as the cornerstone of evolution, which leads to the concept that research and analysis of living systems should be based on their evolutionary history rather than abstract theories. One reason is that traditional mathematical models don't come close to the complexity we see in biology. But the simple programs found in this book generate high complexity, and these programs can reproduce the properties of some organisms, such as some through basic mechanisms. Genetic programs can produce actual biological forms that we can see. This means that new models of a wide range of biological systems may be generated, and the nature of some of their operations may be mimicked for medical purposes. Moreover, in this case, simple programs have general principles that can be applied to biological organisms, making it possible to establish new abstract theories.

### Social Sciences
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Social sciences such as economics and psychology often rely on the mathematical paradigm of physics, but I think new science based on simple procedures is more likely to reveal its basic mechanisms and lead to a large number of applications. It can explain many mysterious phenomena, but it also shows the fundamental limitations of scientific methods. Although new universal theories are possible, it still takes time to get rid of dependence on the details of individual cases.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
From economics to psychology, there is a commonly disputed assumption: the success of physics is unquestionable, with its solid theories always formulated as a series of numbers, equations, and classical mathematics. But I think that if we use the new science based on simple procedures in this book, we will be more likely to capture the basic mechanisms of phenomena in the social sciences, and there will no doubt be many requests to apply my ideas in the social sciences quickly. Indeed, the new intuitions that emerge in this book can explain phenomena that in the past seemed quite mysterious, but the book's conclusion points out that there are some fundamental limitations that are inevitably encountered when applying scientific methods. This creates new problems, but when general theories are possible, it takes time to resolve the inevitable overreliance on the details of particular cases.

### computer Science
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Traditional computer science focuses on complex structures on specific tasks, but often gets simple results. This book emphasizes that the simplest structures can produce complex behavior, leading to new intuitions about the nature of computing. This not only expands the application of computational theory in nature and mathematics, but also provides a new perspective on problems in computer science itself, especially regarding the basic resource requirements of general computing tasks.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
In the brief history of computer science, it has been almost exclusively the study of completing specific tasks on specific machines. But the central point of this book is to consider general scientific problems that arise with any computer. But what I found may be different than what one would expect based on existing computer science. Traditional computer science research tends to produce very complex structures that produce fairly simple results - to suit their specific purposes. But this book will demonstrate that even simple structures can produce complex results, and that thinking about this in terms of computational projects can generate new intuitions about the nature of computation.

One result has been a dramatic expansion of the fields in which computational theory is applied, including in particular a range of fundamental questions about nature and mathematics. Furthermore, the result is a new perspective on existing problems in computer science, especially related to the basic resources required in general types of computing tasks.

### Philosophy
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Since ancient times, people have used philosophy to explore the universe and our role, but science can often provide a clearer context. I believe that the new science of this book will touch upon these fundamental questions: the limits of knowledge, free will, human uniqueness, and mathematical necessity. While traditional intuitions have long constrained our understanding, these discoveries can lead to new intuitions, leading to solutions different from philosophical expectations.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
At any historical period, there are questions about the universe and our role in it that seem to be accessible only through general arguments in philosophy. But advances in science often end up providing a clearer context. I believe that the new science in this book will do just that for a variety of problems that have been considered fundamental since ancient times. These include questions about the ultimate limits of knowledge, free will, the uniqueness of the human condition, and the inevitability of mathematics. Much has been said about each of these questions in the history of philosophy. Inevitably, however, it is informed only by current intuitions about how things should work. But what I discovered in this book led to a whole new intuition. With this intuition, it turns out that one can, for the first time, begin to see solutions to many long-standing problems—often along quite different lines than one would expect based on traditional general philosophical arguments.

### Art
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Nature's forms have long inspired art, while the discovery of simple procedures revealed the underlying mechanisms of complex beauty. Despite conventional intuition that they can only produce bland images, it turns out that minimalist rules can also create stunning beauty, sometimes as natural and sometimes beyond.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Nature seems to easily create forms of great beauty. In the past, however, art was mostly content with imitating these forms. But now, with the discovery that simple programs can capture the fundamental mechanisms of a variety of complex behaviors in nature, one can imagine exploring generalizations to the natural forms we see simply by sampling these programs. Traditional scientific intuition—and early [Computational Art](annotation:computational-art)—might lead one to believe that simple programs will always produce images that are too simple and rigid to be artistically interesting. But as you read through this book, it becomes clear that even a program whose rules may be extremely simple can often produce images of stunning aesthetic quality—sometimes reminiscent of nature, but often unlike anything seen before.

### technology
<div class="content-layer simplified">
The natural world exhibits complexity that transcends technology, and the findings in this book show that simple procedures can capture its fundamental mechanisms, making it possible to imagine new technologies as complex as nature. Traditional engineering believes that complex tasks require complex rules, but in fact, on the contrary, only simple rules are enough, even down to the atomic level. I believe that within decades this will dramatically change the basis of technology and expand humanity's ability to exploit the universe.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Despite this great success, there are still many things in nature that appear to be more complex than any technology can produce. The discovery in this book that simple programs expressed as rules can capture the fundamental mechanisms of nature allows us to imagine a new technology that can realize the complexity of nature. The experience of traditional engineering is that if you want to complete a complex task, you need to build a system with equally complex basic rules. But the findings in this book deny this and actually require only simple underlying rules - as if implemented directly at the atomic level. This book focuses primarily on basic science questions, but I suspect that in just a few decades, what I have done will dramatically change the foundations of technology—and our fundamental ability to harness all that the universe has to offer to our own human ends.

## Some past attempts

### AI
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Artificial intelligence originally aimed to replicate human thinking, but was hampered by the difficulty of explaining how simple parts of the brain produce complex thoughts. The framework proposed in this book may provide this foundation and herald dramatic progress in human-like thinking systems based on it.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
When electronic computers were first invented, it was generally assumed that they would soon be capable of human-like thinking. In the 1960s, the field of artificial intelligence emerged with the goal of understanding human thought processes and implementing them on computers. But that proved more difficult than expected, and after a few spin-offs, little fundamental progress was made. Yet, to some extent, the fundamental problem has been understanding how seemingly simple components in the brain can lead to all the complexity of the mind. But now, with the framework developed in this book, one finally has a meaningful basis on which to do this. Indeed, based on the theoretical and practical ideas in this book, I suspect that it will eventually be possible to make great progress in creating technological systems capable of human-like thinking.

### [Artificial life](annotation:artificial-life)
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Artificial life research has used complex programs to simulate organisms, but this book finds that simple programs are also sufficient, not only to reproduce characteristics, but also to reveal basic mechanisms that are closer to real organisms.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
For as long as machines have existed, people have wondered to what extent they can mimic living systems. The field of artificial life, which was most active from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, was mainly concerned with demonstrating that computer programs could be used to simulate various characteristics of biological systems. But it is usually assumed that the required procedures must be quite complex. However, the findings in this book show that in fact very simple procedures are sufficient. Such procedures make the underlying mechanisms of behavior clearer—and potentially closer to what actually happens in real biological systems.

### [Catastrophe Theory](annotation:catastrophe-theory)
Traditional mathematical models are usually based on continuously changing quantities. In nature, however, discrete changes are often visible. Catastrophe theory, popular in the 1970s, focuses on the fact that even within traditional mathematical models, certain simple discrete changes can still occur. In this book I do not proceed from any assumption of continuity—the types of behavior I study tend to be much more complex than those in mutation theory.

### [Chaos theory](annotation:deterministic-chaos)
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Chaos theory reveals that systems are extremely sensitive to initial conditions and therefore difficult to predict, but this does not necessarily lead to complex behavior. This book shows that systems can often generate highly complex behaviors even with extremely simple initial conditions, a key example of natural complexity.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
The field of chaos theory is based on the discovery that the behavior of a mathematical system is very sensitive to the details of the initial conditions. First noticed in the 19th century, it became prominent with the rise of computer simulation in the 1960s and 1970s. Its main significance is that it means that if the details of any initial conditions are uncertain, then predicting the final behavior of the system will be impossible. But despite the objections of some, this fact alone does not mean that behavior necessarily becomes complex. Indeed, it only means that complexity in the details of the initial conditions will lead to complexity in the behavior of the system at large scales. But if the initial conditions are simple, there is no reason to think that the final behavior will be equally simple. Throughout this book, many of the initial conditions are simple but many systems produce quite complex behavior. I think this phenomenon is an example of explaining the complexity of nature.

### [Complexity Theory](annotation:complexity)

<div class="content-layer simplified">
In the past, complexity research was scattered and limited; this book is based on general simple procedures, systematically studies complexity as a universal phenomenon, and provides a basic understanding framework of its origin.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
My discoveries in the early 1980s led me to believe that complexity could be studied as a fundamental independent phenomenon, and this gradually became popular. But most of the scientific work based on my early findings ended up being more subsumed by other existing scientific frameworks and managed to make little progress on any general and fundamental questions. A characteristic of the new science illustrated in this book is that it ultimately makes possible the development of a fundamental understanding of the complexity of general phenomena and their origins.

### [Computational complexity theory](annotation:computational-complexity)

Computational complexity theory, developed since the 1970s, attempts to describe the difficulty of computational tasks. The specific results are often based on specific programs with complex structures, even if the behavior is simple. And the new science described in this book develops more general types of programs that can shed new light on long-standing questions in computational complexity theory.


### [Cybernetics](annotation:cybernetics)

In the 1940s there was a suggestion that biological systems could be understood based on the simulation of electrical appliances. But essentially, the only available analytical methods come from traditional mathematics, and typically complex biological behavior is rarely successfully captured.


### [Dynamic System Theory](annotation:dynamical-systems)

<div class="content-layer simplified">
Equation-centered approaches to dynamic systems are in many cases too limited; the real behavior of a large number of systems is complex beyond its ability to effectively characterize.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
As a branch of mathematics developed about a century ago, the field of dynamic systems theory focuses on studying systems that change over time through specific mathematical equations and using traditional geometric and other mathematical methods to describe their possible behavioral forms. But what is argued in this book is that in fact the behavior of these systems is inherently too complex to be captured effectively in this way.

### Evolution

<div class="content-layer simplified">
Darwinian selection is not enough to explain the origin of complexity, and is often even the opposite of complexity; this book proposes a new mechanism that can better explain the complex forms in living things.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is often used to explain the complexity of biological systems we see, but in fact in recent years this theory has been used in more than just biology. But what has never been understood is why this theory implies complexity. Indeed I will argue in this book that it is in many ways opposed to complexity. But a new and completely different mechanism is discovered in this book that I believe can effectively explain many of the complex examples we see in the biological world.

### Experimental Mathematics

<div class="content-layer simplified">
Experimental mathematics mostly verifies existing problems; this book takes computational experiments as its core and explores more general systems that go beyond what existing mathematics can resolve.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
The idea of ​​exploring mathematical systems through calculated data has a long history, and with the advent of computers and Mathmatica (Annotation: a mathematical software developed by the author), it has gradually become more widespread. But without exception, it was only suitable for studying problems and systems that have been studied by other mathematical methods in the past. This is very common in the mathematical tradition. My approach in this book is to use computational experiments as a basic method to explore more general systems, which have never appeared in traditional mathematics, and which are usually not understood by existing mathematical methods.

### [fractal geometry](annotation:fractals)
<div class="content-layer simplified">
Fractals emphasize nested complex shapes, but this book also demonstrates a host of more complex, non-nested morphogenesis mechanisms.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Until recently, the only types of shapes widely discussed in science and mathematics were those that were regular or smooth. But starting in the late 1970s, the field of fractal geometry emphasized the importance of nested shapes containing arbitrarily complex parts and argued that such shapes are common in nature. In this book we will encounter a considerable number of systems that produce such nested shapes. But we will also find many systems that produce more complex shapes without nested structures.

### General system theory

General systems theory, which was particularly popular in the 1960s, focused on the study of large networks of primitives—often idealized human organizations. But without the methods in this book, it would be nearly impossible to draw firm conclusions.


### nano technology

Nanotechnology, which has been developing rapidly since the early 1990s, aims to realize technological systems at the atomic scale. But so far its focus has narrowed to familiar machinery and other equipment. The series of systems presented in this book have simple structures but exhibit complex behaviors, some of which are in some ways well suited to direct implementation at the atomic scale.


### Nonlinear Dynamics

Linear mathematical equations are usually very easy to solve and are widely used in science. The nonlinear field focuses on analyzing more complex equations. The most successful one is [Soliton Equations](annotation:soliton-equations), in which linear-like properties can be obtained through careful operation. But systems of the kind discussed in this book often exhibit complex behavior and have no such simplifying properties.


### Scientific Computing

The field of scientific computing is often concerned with using traditional mathematical models - typically for various fluids and solids - and attempting to implement them numerically on computers. In general, it is difficult to separate complex phenomena from the effects of using approximations. Several of the models I propose in this book do not use approximate implementations, but make it easy to identify more complex phenomena.

### [Self-organization](annotation:self-organization)

<div class="content-layer simplified">
Research on self-organization is mostly limited to simple structures; with the framework of this book, we can explain how large-scale complex structures form spontaneously.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
We often see systems in nature that are chaotic and featureless at first, but then involuntarily become organized and produce specific structures. The loose field in self-organization is generally concerned with understanding this phenomenon. But for most parts, they used traditional mathematical models, which resulted in only fairly simple structures being studied. And with the ideas in this book, it's possible to understand how this huge, complex structure came to be.

### Statistical Mechanics

<div class="content-layer simplified">
Statistical mechanics uses averages to cover up the complexity of individual cases and relies on the [Entropy Increase](annotation:entropy-increase). Its foundation has long been questioned; this book provides a new computational framework that is expected to clarify its foundation.
</div>
<div class="content-layer detailed">
Statistical mechanics, a branch of physics that developed a century ago, is concerned with understanding the average behavior in systems composed of large numbers of gas molecules and other parts. For any given instance, such a system will behave in a complex manner. But statistical mechanics often avoids this complexity by looking at averages over a large number of instances. In order to get in touch with the actual situation, it usually uses the so-called second law of thermodynamics, or [Entropy Increase](annotation:entropy-increase). But relying on it for more than a century, there will always be incomprehensible difficulties in understanding this principle. Using the ideas from this book, I feel there would be a framework that could address these issues.

## Personal stories about science in this book

<div class="content-layer simplified">
My interest in these scientific issues began in 1972, when I was twelve years old and became curious about the illustration of a random process on the cover of a physics textbook and tried to simulate it on a computer. It turned out that although the system I constructed was simple, it was already a special case of cellular automata. If it were not for the pursuit of verisimilitude, I might have discovered the core phenomenon in this book in 1974.

I later got involved in theoretical particle physics and made progress, but came to suspect that many of the fundamental questions were irrelevant to the intricate details of the field. I turned to the everyday complexities of nature, only to find that traditional mathematics had little to offer. Inspired by my experience developing symbolic languages ​​and software systems, I decided to start with the simplest model possible.

In the summer of 1981, I conducted an extremely simple computer experiment that resulted in surprisingly complex behavior. This accident prompted me to gradually understand and eventually establish the new scientific framework described in this book.
</div>

<div class="content-layer detailed">
I can trace quite accurately the beginning of my keen interest in the kind of scientific issues discussed in this book to the summer of 1972, when I was twelve years old. I bought a copy of the physics textbook on the right and became extremely curious about the randomization process illustrated on the cover. But being far from convinced by the mathematical explanation given in the book, I decided to try to simulate the process for myself on a computer.

The computers I had access to at the time were very primitive by modern standards. As a result, I had no choice but to work on a very simplified version of the process in the book. I suspected from the beginning that the system I built might be too simple to show any of the phenomena I wanted. After a lot of programming effort, I managed to convince myself that these suspicions were correct.

It turns out, however, that I was working on a special case of the major class of systems I consider in this book: cellular-automata. Were it not for a largely technical problem arising from my desire to make my simulations as physically realistic as possible, it is likely that by 1974 I would have discovered some of the major phenomena that I now describe in this book.

However, at that time I decided to devote my energy to what seemed to be the most fundamental area of ​​science at the time: [Particle Physics](annotation:particle-physics). Over the next few years I did make significant progress in some areas of particle physics and cosmology. But after a while, I began to suspect that many of the most important and fundamental problems I encountered were quite independent of the esoteric details of these fields.

In fact, I realized that even many pertinent questions about common everyday phenomena remain completely unanswered. For example, what is the underlying origin of the complex patterns one sees in [Turbulence](annotation:turbulence)? How are the intricate patterns of snowflakes created? What are the basic mechanisms that allow plants and animals to grow in such complex ways?

What surprises me is how little research seems to have been done on these issues. At first I thought it would be possible to make progress simply by applying some of the complex mathematical techniques I had used in theoretical physics. But it soon became clear that traditional mathematical results for the phenomena I was studying would be very difficult, if not impossible, to find.

So what can I do? As it happened, as a by-product of my work in physics, in 1981 I had just completed the development of a large software system that was in some ways a precursor to some of Mathematica's capabilities. The most difficult part of this project, at least on an intellectual level, was designing the symbolic language on which the system was based. But in the process of developing this language, it became quite clear to me how the few primitive operations I came up with ended up successfully covering a large number of complex computational tasks.

So I thought, maybe I could do something similar in the natural sciences: there might be some suitable primitive elements that I could find and successfully capture a large number of natural phenomena. My ideas weren't that clear at the time, but I believe I implicitly imagined the way this would work was that these primitive elements could be used to build computer programs that simulated the kinds of natural systems that interested me.

In many cases, the various components of these systems have well-established mathematical models. However, there are two practical problems with using these as a basis for simulation. First, these models are often quite complex, making it difficult to include enough components for interesting phenomena to occur given realistic computer resources. Second, even if one does see such phenomena, it is nearly impossible to tell whether they are actually true consequences of the underlying model or simply the result of approximations made when implementing the model on a computer.

But I realized that, at least for many of the phenomena I wanted to study, using the most accurate single-component model was not critical. Because there is evidence from nature, among other things, that in many cases the details of the components do not matter - so, for example, the same complex flow patterns occur in both air and water. With this in mind, I decided that, rather than starting with a detailed realistic model, I would start with a model that was as simple as possible - and easy to set up as a program on a computer.

At first, I had no idea how this would work and how complex the program I would need would be. Indeed, when I studied various simple programs, they always seemed to produce behavior that was much simpler than any system I wanted to study.

But in the summer of 1981, I did what I thought was a fairly straightforward computer experiment to see how all programs of a particular type behaved. I didn't have high expectations for this experiment. But in fact, its results were so surprising and compelling that as I came to understand them, they forced me to change my entire view of science and eventually develop the entire structure of knowledge that I now describe in this book.

The image on the right shows a replica of typical output from my original experiment. The graphics are original, but the intricate patterns they contain are unlike anything I've seen before. At first I couldn't believe they could be correct. But after a while, I became convinced that they were correct - and I realized that I was seeing signs of a rather remarkable and unexpected phenomenon: Even very simple programs can behave with enormous complexity.

But how is it possible that something as fundamental as this has never been noticed before? I scoured the scientific literature, talked to many people, and discovered that a system similar to the one I was working on had been annotated as an "[Cellular Automata](annotation:cellular-automata)" thirty years earlier. But despite a few close attempts, no one has actually tried the kind of experiment I did.

However, I remained skeptical that the basic phenomenon I was seeing must be an obvious consequence of some known scientific principle. But while I did find ideas from fields like chaos theory and [Fractals](annotation:fractals) helpful in explaining some specific features, it seemed that anything close to the entire phenomenon had never been studied.

My early discoveries about [Cellular Automata](annotation:cellular-automata) behavior inspired considerable activity in the scientific community. By the mid-1980s, many applications had been discovered in physics, biology, computer science, mathematics, and other fields. Indeed, some of the phenomena I discovered began to be used as the basis for a new field of study that I called complex systems theory.

Throughout all of this, however, I continued to investigate more fundamental questions, and by about 1985 I began to realize that what I had seen before was just the tip of the iceberg of something far more dramatic and fundamental. But understanding what I was discovering was difficult and required a major shift in intuition.

However, I can see some extraordinary intellectual opportunities ahead. My first thought was to try to organize academia to take advantage of them. So I started a research center and a journal, published a list of problems to attack, and tried to communicate the importance of the direction I was defining.

But while excitement is growing—especially about some of the potential applications—little appears to be being accomplished in moving away from traditional methods and intuition. After a while, I realized that if any significant progress was to be made, it would have to be me. So I was determined to build the best tools and infrastructure I could get my hands on, and then personally pursue the research I thought should be done as efficiently as possible.

In the early 1980s, my biggest obstacle was the practical difficulty of conducting computer experiments using the various rather low-level tools available at the time. But by 1986, I realized that with some new ideas, it was possible to build a single, coherent system to handle all kinds of technical calculations. Since nothing else seemed like anything similar might exist, I decided to build it myself.

The result was Mathematica.

For five years, the process of building Mathematica and the companies around it occupied me. But in 1991—no longer an academic but now the CEO of a successful company—I was able to return to the issues covered in this book.

Equipped with Mathematica, I started trying all kinds of new experiments. The results have been amazing - in a matter of months I've discovered more new things about the simple routine I did than in the past ten years combined. My early work showed me the beginnings of some unexpected and very remarkable phenomena. But now, from my new experiments, I'm starting to see the full power and ubiquity of these phenomena.

As my methodology and intuition improved, my rate of discovery increased, and in just a few years I had brought my exploration of the world of simple programs to the point where I had accumulated a wealth of factual information that would be the envy of many long-established fields of science.

Early on in the process, I've begun to develop a few fairly general principles. The further I travel, the more these principles are confirmed, and the more I realize how powerful and pervasive they are.

When I started in the early 1980s, my goal was primarily to understand complexity phenomena. But by the mid-1990s, I had built a complete intellectual structure that was capable of doing much more and, in fact, laid the foundation for what can only be considered a fundamentally new science.

This was the most exciting moment for me. Because everywhere I turned, there were vast, untouched new areas that I was able to explore for the first time. Each one has its own unique characteristics. But through the overall framework I developed, I gradually was able to answer almost all of the most obvious questions I had.

Initially, I focused mainly on new questions that had never been central to any existing scientific field. But gradually, I realized that the new science I was building should also provide a fundamentally new way to solve fundamental problems in existing fields.

So, around 1994, I began to systematically study each of the major traditional scientific fields. I have long been interested in fundamental questions in many of these areas. But generally I tend to believe most of the conventional wisdom about them. However, as I began to study them in the context of my new science, I kept seeing signs that a large part of this conventional wisdom might be incorrect.

The typical problem is that there are some core problems that traditional methods or intuition have never successfully solved—and that the field has somehow learned to avoid. Yet time and time again, I discovered with excitement that, using my new science, I could suddenly make huge advances—even on questions that in some cases had gone without answers for centuries.

A lot of the stuff I found ended up looking pretty simple given the whole framework I built. But reaching them usually requires a lot of scientific work. Because it's not enough to just be able to take a few concrete technical steps. Rather, in every field, it is necessary to develop an understanding that is broad and deep enough to be able to identify the features of the true essence—which can then be rethought on the basis of my new science.

Doing so certainly requires experience in a variety of different scientific fields. But perhaps most crucially for me, the process is a bit like what I did countless times when designing Mathematica: start with complex technical ideas and gradually see how to capture their essential characteristics with something extremely simple. I've successfully done this so many times in Mathematica, which is part of what gave me the confidence to try doing similar things in various scientific fields.

In hindsight, it often seems almost strange that I ended up reaching conclusions that had never been reached before. But by studying the history of each field, I could see in many cases how it was led astray by a lack of some key methodology or intuition that was now emerging in the new science I was developing.

When I first made the discovery about [Cellular Automata](annotation:cellular-automata) in the early 1980s, I suspected that I was seeing the beginning of something important. But I had no idea how important it would end up being. Indeed, over the past twenty years I have discovered much more than I ever imagined. The new science that I spent so much energy building seems to have become an increasingly central and critical direction for the future development of knowledge.
