## Cellular Automata Collection

1. [Growing Neural Cellular Automata](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/) - Distill's in-depth article shows how to train the system to grow, repair and maintain its shape through the differentiable cellular automata framework.

## Research Notes

- You can record personal experiments, thoughts or reading excerpts here to continuously supplement your research track.
- If there are topics worthy of long-term tracking, they can be split into new sections by category to keep the structure clear.

## Follow-up plan

- Organize more excellent resources related to cellular automata, complex systems and automated modeling.
- Combine with the interactive demonstration on this site to record your own exploration steps and experiences.
