# Chapter 3: The World of Simple Programs

## Exploring Program Space

Wolfram expands beyond cellular automata to explore other simple computational systems, establishing that complex behavior is ubiquitous across different types of programs.

## Types of Systems Explored

- **Substitution systems**: String rewriting rules
- **Mobile automata**: Moving elements on arrays
- **Tag systems**: Sequential processing rules
- **Register machines**: Simple computational models

## Universal Patterns

The chapter demonstrates that complexity emerges across all these different computational paradigms, suggesting universal principles at work.

## Key Insights

- Complex behavior is not limited to cellular automata
- Simple programs across many domains show similar complexity
- There may be universal laws governing computational complexity
