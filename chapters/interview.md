In a conversation on the Lex Fridman Podcast, Stephen Wolfram discusses the integration of ChatGPT with Wolfram Alpha and Wolfram Language. He highlights the key differences between large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and computational systems.

**Key Differences:**

* **LLMs (like ChatGPT):** These models focus on generating human-like language by identifying patterns in vast amounts of text data [[01:53:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=6787)]. Wolfram refers to this as "wide and shallow" computation, where the model uses neural networks to provide statistically likely continuations of prompts [[42:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=2522)].
* **Wolfram's Computational System (Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Language):** In contrast, this system is designed for "deep computation" [[48:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=2882)]. It computes answers based on formal structures like mathematics and systematic knowledge, allowing for complex calculations to derive new information rather than just matching existing patterns [[48:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=2938)].

**Computational Irreducibility and Observers:**

Wolfram explains that even simple programs can produce highly complex and unpredictable results, a concept he calls "computational irreducibility" [[01:25:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=5131)]. This implies that the only way to determine the outcome of a computation is to run it, as there are no shortcuts. He connects this to the idea of "observers" [[01:07:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=4027)], suggesting that humans, as computationally bounded beings, exist in "pockets of reducibility" within a largely irreducible universe. Our minds simplify and abstract reality, creating symbolic representations that enable coherent thought and communication. This simplification is crucial to our experience of reality, including our sense of self over time [[01:13:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=4382)]. Wolfram also proposes that the laws of physics emerge from the interaction between this underlying irreducible reality and the nature of computationally bounded observers [[04:01:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=14460)].

**Evolution of Language and Thought:**

The discussion also explores the possibility that ChatGPT is uncovering "laws of language" or "semantic grammar" that go beyond syntax [[01:10:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=4253)]. Wolfram suggests that just as Aristotle identified patterns of logic in rhetoric, LLMs are discovering deeper regularities in how meaning is constructed in language [[01:10:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=4253)]. He speculates that these "laws of thought" might be a finite set of rules that determine a sentence's potential for meaning [[01:33:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=5615)]. The integration of LLMs with computational language creates a powerful workflow where humans provide natural language prompts, LLMs generate precise code, and the code can be refined by either the LLM or a human [[01:36:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=5781)]. Wolfram envisions a future where LLMs make deep computational tools accessible to people without traditional programming skills [[03:21:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=12110)].

**Challenges and the Future of AI:**

Despite their capabilities, LLMs have limitations in "deep computation" [[02:20:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=8400)]. They excel at simple tasks but can produce plausible-sounding but incorrect information [[02:20:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=8400)]. Wolfram shares anecdotes of LLMs generating fictional facts about blue wolves or playing the wrong song when requested [[02:08:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=7726)]. He is optimistic about the existential risks of AI, believing that computational irreducibility makes a perfectly predictable superintelligence unlikely [[04:47:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=17220)]. He likens the challenge of controlling AI to humanity's ongoing struggle to understand and navigate the unpredictable natural world [[04:47:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=17220)]. In the future, Wolfram anticipates that humans will become more like generalists and philosophers, focusing on setting objectives while AI handles the mechanical computation [[03:36:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=12960)]. He also foresees the rise of "computational X" (CX) as a fundamental educational concept, teaching people how to think computationally about the world [[04:50:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdE-waSx-d8&t=17400)].
