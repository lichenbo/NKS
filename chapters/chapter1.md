# Chapter 1: The Foundations for a New Kind of Science

## Simple Rules, Complex Behavior

Wolfram introduces the central thesis that simple computational rules can generate remarkably complex behavior. This challenges traditional mathematical approaches that assume simple rules lead to simple outcomes.

Key insight: [Rule 30](annotation:rule30) demonstrates how a trivial cellular automaton rule can produce patterns that appear random despite being completely deterministic.

The implications extend beyond computer science into [biology](annotation:biology), [physics](annotation:physics), and other natural sciences.

## Traditional Science vs. Computational Approach

Traditional science has focused on mathematical equations, often seeking simple formulas to describe complex phenomena. Wolfram argues this approach is fundamentally limited.

The computational approach suggests that [computation](annotation:computation) itself is a more fundamental framework for understanding nature than mathematics.

## Historical Context

Wolfram traces how computational thinking emerged, from [von Neumann's](annotation:vonneumann) work on cellular automata to the development of computer science.

The chapter establishes why this "new kind of science" was not possible before the computer age.

## Key Takeaways

- Simple rules can generate complex behavior
- Traditional mathematical approaches have limitations
- Computation may be more fundamental than mathematics
- The computer age enabled new scientific methodologies
