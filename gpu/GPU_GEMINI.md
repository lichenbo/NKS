## 1. Overview & Goal

This document outlines a plan to enhance the Cellular Automata (CA) feature of the NKS project by leveraging GPU acceleration. 

The user requested a proposal to move the rendering and computation of the CA from the CPU to the GPU. The primary goal is to improve performance, resulting in smoother animations and a more responsive user interface, especially on high-resolution displays or with more complex CA rules.

The current implementation uses the standard 2D Canvas API, which is CPU-bound. The proposed solution is to refactor this using WebGL 2.0.

## 2. Technology Evaluation: WebGL vs. WebGPU

To implement GPU acceleration on the web, there are two primary APIs: WebGL and its successor, WebGPU. The choice between them has significant implications for performance, features, and compatibility.

### 2.1. At a Glance

| Feature | WebGL (1.0 & 2.0) | WebGPU |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API Model** | High-level, stateful (based on OpenGL ES). Manages a global state machine. | Lower-level, mostly stateless, object-oriented (based on Vulkan/Metal/DX12). |
| **Performance** | Higher CPU overhead. The browser driver translates commands, which can be slow. | Lower CPU overhead. More direct control over the GPU, leading to better performance. |
| **GPU Compute** | No dedicated compute shaders in WebGL 1. Available but limited in WebGL 2. | **First-class, powerful compute shader support.** |
| **Multi-threading**| Primarily single-threaded. Heavy work can block the main UI thread. | Designed for multi-threading. Can prepare rendering work on worker threads. |
| **Browser Support**| Universal (WebGL 1), Wide (WebGL 2). | Modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox). In progress for Safari. |
| **Future** | Legacy. Supported for backward compatibility but not actively developed. | **The future standard.** Actively developed by all major browser vendors. |

### 2.2. Key Differences Explained

#### API Philosophy
*   **WebGL** uses a "global state machine." You call functions that change a global state, which can be complex to manage and is a common source of bugs.
*   **WebGPU** is object-oriented and largely stateless. You create explicit "pipeline state objects" that contain all the necessary information for a draw call. This is more verbose but makes the code much more robust and predictable.

#### Performance
*   **WebGL**'s design requires the browser's driver to do a lot of work to translate your JavaScript calls into what the underlying hardware actually understands. This translation layer adds CPU overhead.
*   **WebGPU** was designed specifically to reduce this overhead. Its API maps more directly to modern GPU hardware, resulting in lower CPU usage and better performance.

#### GPU Compute (Most Relevant Difference for This Project)
*   **WebGPU** has **first-class support for compute shaders**. It is the ideal tool for running simulations like cellular automata, as the computation can be done independently of the rendering pipeline.
*   **WebGL 2.0** can achieve the same outcome by using a **fragment shader** to perform the calculations, a common and effective technique for GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on GPU).

### 2.3. Recommendation for This Project

While WebGPU is the technically superior and more future-proof technology, **I recommend using WebGL 2.0 for this project.**

**Justification:**
1.  **Compatibility**: WebGL 2.0 has near-universal support across modern browsers, ensuring the project remains accessible to the widest possible audience. WebGPU is still being rolled out in some browsers (notably Safari).
2.  **Sufficiency**: For the task of rendering these cellular automata, the GPGPU capabilities of WebGL 2.0's fragment shaders are more than sufficient to achieve a massive performance boost.
3.  **Project Alignment**: Implementing this in pure, vanilla WebGL 2.0 aligns perfectly with the project's existing architecture of using dependency-free JavaScript without a build step.

## 3. Detailed Implementation Plan (WebGL 2.0)

This plan outlines the steps to refactor the CA rendering in `script.js`.

### Phase 1: Analysis & Setup

1.  **Analyze Current Code**: Thoroughly examine the existing CA rendering functions in `script.js` for both the background and header canvases to understand the current state management and drawing logic.
2.  **Get WebGL Context**: Modify the canvas initialization to request a `webgl2` context. Include fallback logic to either inform the user their browser is unsupported or potentially fall back to the 2D canvas renderer.

### Phase 2: WebGL Implementation

1.  **Shaders (GLSL)**: The rendering logic will be written in GLSL and stored as JavaScript strings.
    *   **Vertex Shader**: A simple pass-through shader to draw a 2D plane that fills the canvas. This is standard boilerplate for 2D GPGPU tasks.
    *   **Fragment Shader**: The core of the new implementation. For each pixel (cell), this shader will:
        *   Read the state of the corresponding cell and its neighbors from an input texture (the previous generation).
        *   Apply the cellular automaton rule (e.g., Rule 30) in shader code.
        *   Output the resulting new color for the cell.

2.  **"Ping-Pong" Textures & Framebuffers**: To manage the state between generations without race conditions, I will implement a "ping-pong" technique:
    *   Two textures (A and B) and two corresponding framebuffers will be created.
    *   **Frame 1**: Read from Texture A (input) and write the new state to Framebuffer B (which is backed by Texture B).
    *   **Frame 2**: Swap roles. Read from Texture B and write the new state to Framebuffer A.
    *   This cycle repeats, with the textures and framebuffers swapping roles in each frame.

3.  **Render Loop**: The main `requestAnimationFrame` loop will be refactored to perform the following steps:
    1.  Bind the "output" framebuffer.
    2.  Activate the GLSL shader program.
    3.  Pass the "input" texture to the shader as a uniform.
    4.  Draw a single quad that covers the canvas, executing the fragment shader for every pixel.
    5.  Render the final output texture to the actual canvas display.
    6.  Swap the input/output textures for the next animation frame.

### Phase 3: Code Structure

*   All new logic will be encapsulated within the existing `script.js` file to maintain the project structure.
*   Helper functions will be created for common WebGL tasks like compiling shaders, creating programs, and setting up textures/framebuffers. This will keep the main logic clean and readable.
*   The CA rules (like Rule 30, 90, 110) will be implemented directly in the fragment shader code, likely using `if/else` statements or lookup tables passed in as uniforms.

## 4. Conclusion

This plan provides a clear path to implementing GPU-accelerated cellular automata using WebGL 2.0. It will deliver a significant performance improvement, result in much smoother animations, and respect the project's existing architectural principles of using vanilla, dependency-free JavaScript.
