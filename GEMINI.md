# GEMINI.md

This file provides guidance to Gemini when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a client-side web application that presents notes and annotations for Stephen Wolfram's "A New Kind of Science". The project creates an interactive reading experience with three columns: chapter outline, main content, and detailed annotations.

## Architecture

- **Pure vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks or build tools required
- **Static file serving** - All content is served as static files
- **Markdown-based content** - Chapter notes and annotations stored as individual `.md` files
- **Client-side rendering** - Uses `marked.js` library to parse markdown on the client
- **Animation libraries** - Uses AOS (Animate On Scroll) and custom incremental typing for visual effects
- **Multilingual support** - Full English/Chinese/Japanese language system with separate content files
- **Modular JavaScript architecture** - Core functionality separated into focused modules using IIFE patterns and APP namespace

## Development Commands

Since this is a static HTML/CSS/JS project with no build system:

- **Local development**: Use any static file server (e.g., `python -m http.server 8000` or `npx serve`)
- **No build step required** - Files can be opened directly in browser or served statically
- **No linting configured** - Standard web development practices apply

## Content Management

### Chapter System
- **Adding chapters**: Create new `.md` files in `chapters/` directory following naming pattern `chapter[N].md`
- **Hybrid chapter approach**: Chapter 1 uses hybrid format combining comprehensive technical coverage with engaging personal narrative
  - `chapter1.md` contains the hybrid approach with Wolfram's personal discovery journey integrated throughout
  - Maintains all annotation links and educational completeness from academic structure
  - Integrates first-person narrative elements for enhanced reader engagement while preserving technical depth
- **Layered content system**: Chapter 1 Chinese version (`chapters/zh/chapter1_layered.md`) uses special layered format
  - Content organized into `.content-layer.simplified` and `.content-layer.detailed` sections
  - Expand/collapse buttons (`<button class="expand-toggle">`) allow progressive disclosure
  - Detailed sections start hidden and can be expanded section by section
  - Only available for Chinese language version - English/Japanese use regular format
  - Automatically detected and loaded when viewing Chapter 1 in Chinese
- **Multilingual chapters**: Add corresponding files in `chapters/zh/` for Chinese and `chapters/ja/` for Japanese versions
- **Chapter navigation**: Update chapter list in `index.html` and add translations to `script.js` translations object
- **Visual content**: Enhanced with educational images and computational art examples to improve accessibility

### Annotation System
- **Individual annotation files**: Each annotation is stored as a separate `.md` file in `annotations/` directory
- **Annotation naming**: Use kebab-case naming (e.g., `cellular-automata.md`, `emergence.md`, `computational-art.md`)
- **Multilingual annotations**: Add corresponding files in `annotations/zh/` for Chinese and `annotations/ja/` for Japanese versions
- **Linking annotations**: Use `[text](annotation:key)` syntax in chapter markdown files
- **Internal link restriction**: Annotation files should NOT contain internal annotation links `[text](annotation:key)` to prevent non-functional links
- **External links only**: Only external links (http/https) are allowed in annotation files and will open in new tabs
- **Visual content**: Annotations enhanced with educational images, diagrams, and computational art examples
- **Annotation caching**: Annotations are cached by language in `annotationCache` object

### Language System
- **Default language**: Application defaults to Chinese ('zh') for new users
- **Three-way language toggle**: Header displays all three languages (EN | ‰∏≠Êñá | Êó•Êú¨Ë™û) simultaneously with active highlighting
- **Persistent language**: User's language preference is saved in localStorage as 'nks-language'
- **Content loading**: System automatically loads correct language version of chapters and annotations
- **Fallback system**: Japanese content falls back to Chinese, then English if translation doesn't exist
- **Translation object**: All UI text is stored in `translations` object in `js/translations.js` with complete EN/ZH/JA support

## Translation and Content Notes
- **Chinese Title for "A New Kind of Science"**: The standard Chinese translation for the book title "A New Kind of Science" should be "‰∏ÄÁßçÊñ∞ÁßëÂ≠¶", not "‰∏ÄÁßçÊñ∞ÁöÑÁßëÂ≠¶". This has been updated across all relevant files.

## Technical Notes

### Cellular Automata System
- Background canvas runs Rule 30 continuously with slow animation (200ms intervals)
- Header canvas cycles through different cellular automata rules with faster animation (150ms intervals)
- Both use golden color scheme with gradient and age-based fading effects
- Rule indicators in header show current background and header rules with language support

### Conway's Game of Life Demo
- **Interactive canvas** with mouse click and touch input support for cell toggling
- **Control system**: Play/Pause, Step, Clear, Random, and speed controls (0.25x to 10x)
- **Grid size options**: 20√ó20, 40√ó40, 100√ó100, 300√ó300 with sophisticated initial patterns
- **Pattern library**: 12 famous Conway patterns with emoji icons and trilingual names
- **Game logic**: Complete implementation of Conway's rules with neighbor counting
- **Mobile optimizations**: Touch event handling, responsive canvas sizing, and flowing button layout
- **Trilingual support**: All UI elements and instructions available in English, Chinese, and Japanese
- **Advanced features**: Orientation change handling, coordinate scaling for accuracy, and visual feedback

### Annotation System
- **Desktop Mode (‚â•769px)**: Annotations display in right sidebar with custom incremental typing effect
- **Tablet & Mobile Mode (‚â§768px)**: Inline annotations insert directly into document flow
- **Inline Annotation Behavior**:
  - Insert immediately after paragraph/element containing clicked link
  - Push down subsequent content naturally (occupy document space)
  - Stay fixed with content during scrolling (not floating overlays)
  - Single instance: remove existing annotations before creating new ones
  - Expand/collapse toggle button (‚àí/+) for content control
  - Smooth auto-scroll to bring annotation into view
- **Processing**: Links use pattern `[text](annotation:key)` converted to `<span class="annotation-link" data-annotation="key">text</span>`
- **Content**: Custom incremental typing supports HTML content with proper cursor styling
- **Visual**: Active annotation links highlighted with golden background

### Layered Content System
- **Chapter detection**: `loadChapter()` function automatically detects Chapter 1 + Chinese language combination
- **Special loading**: Uses `chapters/zh/chapter1_layered.md` instead of regular chapter file
- **Content structure**: Markdown contains HTML divs with `.content-layer.simplified` and `.content-layer.detailed` classes
- **Toggle buttons**: `<button class="expand-toggle" data-expanded="false">` elements control section visibility
- **JavaScript functions**:
  - `initLayeredContentSystem()` - Sets up event listeners for expand/collapse buttons
  - `toggleLayeredSection()` - Handles expanding/collapsing with smooth animations
  - `updateToggleText()` - Updates button text based on current language and state
- **Progressive disclosure**: Detailed content starts hidden (`display: none`) and expands on demand
- **Auto-scroll**: Expanded content automatically scrolls into view for better UX
- **Responsive**: Works on all device sizes with adjusted button sizing

### Language Implementation
- Fallback system: Japanese ‚Üí Chinese ‚Üí English for missing translations
- Language-specific caching prevents cross-language content mixing
- All UI elements use `data-i18n` attributes for automatic translation updates
- Chapter links are dynamically updated when language changes
- Three-button language selector shows all options simultaneously with active highlighting

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with breakpoints at 480px, 768px, 900px, 1024px, 1200px, 1400px
- Three-column layout collapses to stacked layout on tablets and below (‚â§768px)
- Annotations column is hidden in stacked layout (‚â§768px) to prevent duplication
- JavaScript handles annotation display: sidebar (‚â•769px) or inline (‚â§768px)
- Outline panel becomes non-sticky on tablets/mobile with reduced max-height
- Chapter navigation becomes grid layout on mobile for better touch interaction
- **Language switcher mobile optimization**: Header content positioned with adequate top margin (3rem on tablets, 3.5rem on phones) to prevent overlap with language selector

### Mobile Navigation Enhancement
- **Scroll-to-Top Button**: Fixed circular button in bottom-right corner (mobile phones only ‚â§480px)
- **Smart Visibility**: Appears only after scrolling 300px down from top
- **Responsive Sizing**: 50px (tablet) ‚Üí 45px (mobile) ‚Üí 40px (small mobile)
- **Smooth Behavior**: Throttled scroll detection and smooth scroll animation
- **Visual Design**: Glass-morphism with golden hover effects matching site theme
- **Touch-Friendly**: Adequate size for mobile touch targets with hover feedback

### NKS Chatbot System
- **API Integration**: Connects to RAG model API for intelligent responses about book content
- **Responsive Behavior**: Different UI patterns for desktop vs mobile
  - Desktop (‚â•769px): Input bar aligned with annotations column, expands to conversation view
  - Mobile (‚â§768px): Round floating button that opens full-screen conversation
- **State Management**: Tracks conversation history, typing indicators, and expanded states
- **Dynamic Positioning**: JavaScript calculates exact alignment with annotations column on desktop
- **Language Support**: Multilingual placeholders and UI elements with automatic translation updates
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures with user-friendly error messages
- **Visual Consistency**: Glass-morphism design with golden accents matching site aesthetic

### Modular JavaScript Architecture
- **IIFE Pattern**: All modules use Immediately Invoked Function Expression pattern for encapsulation
- **APP Namespace**: Consistent `window.APP` namespace prevents global scope pollution
- **Revealing Module Pattern**: Each module exposes only necessary public methods through APP namespace
- **Loading Order**: Critical dependency order: `translations.js` ‚Üí `chatbot.js` ‚Üí `game-of-life.js` ‚Üí `script.js`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Global window exposure maintained for existing functionality
- **Module Structure**:
  ```javascript
  (function(APP) {
      'use strict';
      // Module implementation
      APP.ModuleName = {
          publicMethod1,
          publicMethod2
      };
  })(window.APP = window.APP || {});
  ```
- **Benefits**: Improved maintainability, reduced script.js size from ~3000+ to ~1750 lines (40% reduction)
