# Fractals

Fractals are geometric shapes that display self-similarity at all scales - meaning they look similar whether you zoom in or zoom out. They are characterized by infinite detail, infinite length, and often have a fractional dimension.

## Key Properties

**Self-Similarity**: The same pattern repeats at different scales. A small part of the fractal looks like the whole.

**Infinite Detail**: No matter how much you magnify a fractal, you will always find more intricate structure.

**Fractional Dimension**: Unlike regular shapes (lines are 1D, squares are 2D), fractals can have dimensions like 1.5 or 2.3.

**Recursive Generation**: Most fractals are created by repeating a simple process over and over again.

## Famous Examples

**Mandelbrot Set**: Perhaps the most famous fractal, discovered by Benoit Mandelbrot, featuring intricate spirals and bulbs.

**Koch Snowflake**: Created by repeatedly adding triangular bumps to each side of a triangle.

**Sierpinski Triangle**: Formed by recursively removing triangular sections from a larger triangle.

*The Sierpinski triangle emerges naturally from Rule 90 cellular automaton, demonstrating the connection between computational processes and fractal geometry*

**Fern Leaf**: Computer-generated fractals that closely resemble natural fern leaves.

## Fractals in Nature

Nature is full of fractal-like structures:
- Coastlines and mountain ranges
- Tree branches and root systems
- Blood vessels and lung airways
- Clouds and lightning patterns
- Snowflakes and crystals

## Mathematical Discovery

While fractal-like objects were studied earlier, the modern field of fractal geometry was largely developed by Benoit Mandelbrot in the 1970s. He coined the term "fractal" from the Latin "fractus," meaning broken or fragmented.

## Fractals in Cellular Automata

## Significance to Wolfram's Work

Traditional fractals show nested, repetitive patterns. Wolfram's work explores how simple computational rules can generate much more complex patterns that go beyond the regular self-similarity of classical fractals. Rule 90 demonstrates how cellular automata can naturally produce well-known fractal structures, suggesting that fractal geometry may emerge spontaneously from simple computational processes.
