# Cellular Automata

Cellular automata are discrete models consisting of a grid of cells that evolve through time according to simple rules:

- **Grid Structure:** Regular arrangement of cells in one, two, or more dimensions
- **Local Rules:** Each cell's next state depends only on its current state and nearby neighbors
- **Synchronous Updates:** All cells update simultaneously at each time step
- **Simple States:** Cells typically have just two states (0/1, on/off, alive/dead)

Despite their simplicity, cellular automata can model complex phenomena including biological growth, physical processes, and computational systems.
