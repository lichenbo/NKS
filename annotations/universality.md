# Universality in Complex Systems

Universality refers to the remarkable finding that complex behavior is not rare but ubiquitous:

- **Independence from Details:** Complex behavior arises regardless of specific system implementation
- **Cross-Domain Patterns:** Similar patterns appear in physics, biology, economics, and social systems
- **Computational Universality:** Many simple systems can perform arbitrary computations
- **Threshold Behavior:** Complexity emerges beyond a minimal threshold of rule sophistication

This universality suggests deep underlying principles governing complex systems across all of nature.
