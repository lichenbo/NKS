# Emergence from Simple Rules

The central discovery that simple computational rules can produce immense complexity challenges fundamental assumptions about causation:

- **Counterintuitive Results:** Complexity doesn't require complex causes or elaborate plans
- **Universal Phenomenon:** This behavior appears across vastly different systems and domains
- **Irreducible Complexity:** The resulting patterns often cannot be predicted without running the computation
- **Natural Implications:** Suggests many natural phenomena arise from simple underlying rules

Examples include weather patterns, biological growth, market dynamics, and social behaviors.
