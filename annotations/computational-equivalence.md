# Principle of Computational Equivalence

Wolfram's most ambitious hypothesis states that almost all systems perform computations of equivalent sophistication:

- **Universal Computation:** Simple programs, human brains, and natural processes all achieve the same computational level
- **Irreducibility:** No system can predict another's behavior faster than running the computation
- **Natural Intelligence:** Intelligence emerges naturally from computational processes, not special complexity
- **Limits to Science:** Some phenomena may be fundamentally unpredictable due to computational irreducibility

This principle implies fundamental limits to knowledge while suggesting intelligence and complexity are far more common than traditionally believed.
