# Scientific Paradigm Shift

Wolfram's "New Kind of Science" represents a fundamental paradigm shift in scientific thinking:

- **From Mathematical to Computational:** Moving beyond traditional mathematical equations to computational rules
- **From Reductionism to Emergence:** Understanding how simple parts interact to create complex wholes
- **From Continuous to Discrete:** Viewing nature as fundamentally discrete rather than continuous
- **From Deterministic Predictability:** Accepting that simple rules can produce unpredictable complexity

This shift parallels other major scientific revolutions like those initiated by Copernicus, Newton, Darwin, and Einstein.
