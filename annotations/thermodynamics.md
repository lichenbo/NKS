# Thermodynamics

Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with heat, work, temperature, and energy. It describes how energy moves and changes form in physical systems, from steam engines to living organisms to the entire universe.

## The Four Laws

**Zeroth Law**: If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This allows us to define temperature.

**First Law**: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another (conservation of energy).

**Second Law**: Entropy (disorder) of an isolated system always increases over time.

**Third Law**: As temperature approaches absolute zero, entropy approaches a minimum value.

## Key Concepts

**Heat**: Thermal energy in transit from a hot object to a cold object.

**Work**: Energy transfer that results in motion or change in a system.

**Temperature**: A measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance.

**Equilibrium**: A state where all parts of a system are at the same temperature and no net heat flow occurs.

## Real-World Applications

- Steam engines and car engines
- Refrigerators and air conditioners
- Power plants and turbines
- Understanding weather and climate
- Biological processes like metabolism

## Historical Development

Developed in the 19th century during the Industrial Revolution, thermodynamics emerged from practical needs to understand steam engines and improve their efficiency.

## Connection to Wolfram's Work

Traditional thermodynamics uses statistical methods to explain the behavior of countless particles. Wolfram proposes that simple computational rules might provide an alternative explanation for thermodynamic phenomena.
