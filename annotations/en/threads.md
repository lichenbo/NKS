# Threads

In the Wolfram Physics Project and related network models, "threads" are additional connections across a hypergraph or causal network that enable non-local correlations between different nodes. These connections allow phenomena such as quantum entanglement to be explained without the need for superluminal effects in conventional continuous space.

## Key points
- **Non-local connections**: Clues directly link nodes that are far apart in ordinary space.
- **Quantum Interpretation**: It can be regarded as a "bridge" between multiple branches, supporting quantum correlations such as Bell inequality violations.
- **GEOMETRY SIGNIFICANCE**: May appear as effective curvature or additional dimensions on a macroscopic scale.

## NKS association
- Build discrete spatiotemporal models together with causal networks and hypergraph replacement rules.
- Helps to reproduce quantum behavior and information propagation from computational structures.
