# Bessel function

Bessel function is a special function that satisfies Bessel differential equation `x^2 y'' + x y' + (x^2 - n^2) y = 0`, often written as `J_n(x)`, `Y_n(x)`, etc. They appear naturally in continuous media problems such as cylindrical or spherical symmetry waves, heat conduction, and electromagnetic fields, and describe modes that propagate in the radial direction and have oscillation attenuation. Therefore, in physics and engineering, they belong to the "standard family of functions" like trigonometric functions, and usually present regular periodic or quasi-periodic curves.
