# turbulence

Turbulence refers to the highly irregular and chaotic state of fluid under high Reynolds number conditions, which is characterized by rapid fluctuations in speed and pressure in time and space, forming a series of vortices and cross-scale energy cascades.

## Key Features
- **High Reynolds number**: Inertial forces overwhelm viscous forces, causing the laminar flow to destabilize and enter turbulent flow.
- **Multi-scale structure**: Large-scale vortices continue to break up into small-scale vortices, forming an energy cascade.
- **Statistical Description**: The transient state is difficult to predict and can only be characterized by statistics such as average velocity, turbulence intensity, and spectral functions.
- **Dissipation and Mixing**: Turbulence significantly enhances the mixing and dissipation efficiency of momentum, heat and matter.

## NKS perspective
- Simple local rules can generate complex textures at multiple scales, suggesting that the multi-level eddy structure of turbulence may be characterized by simple procedural models.
- Computational irreducibility means that turbulence evolution cannot be predicted quickly through closed formulations, and stepwise simulation is often the only means.
- Both multipath systems and turbulence exhibit the phenomenon of "path explosion": small local differences quickly amplify over time.
