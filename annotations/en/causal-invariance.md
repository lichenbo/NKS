# Causal invariance

Causal invariance refers to the fact that no matter in which order the local updates of the system are performed, as long as all required updates eventually occur, the structure of the overall causal network remains unchanged.

## Core connotation
- **Free update order**: The execution order of local events can be different, but the graph of their causal dependencies is the same.
- **Unique History**: Different execution paths merge into the same causal network, providing a consistent global "history".

## NKS and physical meaning
- In multi-way systems or network replacement models, causal invariance ensures that the different branches eventually converge, giving consistency to the macroscopic physical laws.
- Observer consistency underpinning special relativity: all inertial frames see the same physical laws.
- is one of the necessary conditions for recovering continuous space-time from discrete rules.
