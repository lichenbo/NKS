# self-organizing

Self-organization refers to the process in which a system spontaneously forms an ordered structure or functional pattern based on local interactions without central control, external "design" or fine-tuning of parameters. The initial state can be highly disordered (e.g., randomly configured), and recognizable patterns and hierarchies can emerge from repeated application of simple rules.

## Key Features
- Decentralization: there is no global command, order comes from the parallel action of local rules
- Structure generation: stripes, patches, interfaces, mobile structures, etc. appear from homogeneous or random initial states
- Robustness: Has a certain tolerance for noise and disturbance, and can often restore or maintain the mode
- Simple rules: minimalist update rules can produce complex, organized macroscopic behaviors

## Typical examples (cross-domain)
- Physics and chemistry: convection cells, diffusion-reaction patterns, separation of granular media
- Biological systems: cell differentiation and morphogenesis, group movement (fish/bird flocks), neural synchronization
- Computing system: Cellular automaton generates structures from random initial states and pattern formation of swarm intelligence algorithms

## Relation to this book
- Computational perspective: Treat the system as a program, emphasizing the universality of "simple rules â†’ complex order"
- Experimental method: directly iterate the rules from the random initial state on the computer and observe how order emerges
- Irreducibility: Even if the rules are simple, the calculation of the overall behavior is often irreducible, and predictions need to be calculated step by step.

## Differences from related concepts
- Self-organization vs design: Order is not gradually constructed by external designers, but emerges endogenously
- Self-organization vs. Chaos: Chaos emphasizes sensitive dependence and long-term unpredictability; self-organization emphasizes the generation and maintenance of patterns (the two can coexist)
