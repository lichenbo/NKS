# Cellular Automata

Cellular automata are discrete models consisting of a grid of cells that evolve through time according to simple rules:

- **Grid Structure:** Regular arrangement of cells in one, two, or more dimensions
- **Local Rules:** Each cell's next state depends only on its current state and nearby neighbors
- **Synchronous Updates:** All cells update simultaneously at each time step
- **Simple States:** Cells typically have just two states (0/1, on/off, alive/dead)

Despite their simplicity, cellular automata can model complex phenomena including biological growth, physical processes, and computational systems.

## Elementary Cellular Automata

One-dimensional cellular automata, known as elementary cellular automata, provide the simplest examples of these systems. Each rule is defined by how a cell's next state depends on its current state and its two immediate neighbors.

## Universal Computation

Some cellular automata, like Rule 110, are capable of universal computation, meaning they can simulate any computational process given sufficient time and space.

## Applications

Cellular automata serve as powerful models for:
- Pattern formation in biology
- Physical processes like crystal growth
- Traffic flow and crowd dynamics
- Digital physics and computational models of reality
