# Wolfram Physics Project

The Wolfram Physics Project, launched in 2020 by Stephen Wolfram, aims to reconstruct fundamental physics through minimalist, discrete computational rules. The project explores the ultimate physical model under the framework of multi-path systems, hypergraphs, causal networks, etc., with the goal of using simple programs to explain phenomena such as space, time, quantum mechanics, and gravity.

## Core idea
- **Hypergraph Representation Space**: The universe is modeled as a continuously rewritten hypergraph, whose nodes and hyperedges represent basic elements and their relationships.
- **Causal Network**: Rewrite the causal relationship between events to form a network, which can emerge a relativistic space-time structure.
- **Multi-path systems and quantum behavior**: All possible rewriting paths exist in parallel, branching and merging to simulate quantum superposition and measurement effects.
- **Strings and Particles**: Particles can be viewed as persistent structures in causal networks or as specific topological features in hypergraphs.

## Contact with NKS
- Continuing the idea of ​​"simple rules generate the complexity of the universe" in *A New Kind of Science*.
- Explore the manifestations of computational equivalence, universality and computational irreducibility in basic physics.
- Find candidate rules that satisfy physical constraints through large-scale computational experiments (Wolfram Language, distributed search).
