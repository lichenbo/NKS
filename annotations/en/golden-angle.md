The Golden Angle is the embodiment of the golden section in the angle field, which is approximately 137.5°, corresponding to the smaller angle between the two sections on the unit circle divided according to the golden ratio. It often appears in plant phyllotaxis and is thought to distribute space most evenly.

## Mathematical definition
- Related to the golden ratio φ = (1 + √5) / 2
- On the unit circle, the golden angle = 360° × (1 - 1/φ) ≈ 137.508°
- can also be written as approximately 2.3999632 radians

## Natural examples
- Arrangement of leaves, seeds, and petals on plant stems
- Spiral textures of pine cones, sunflowers and pineapples
- Many shells, spiral patterns in growth structures

## NKS perspective
- The golden angle can be naturally generated by simple local rules without complex optimization.
- Reflecting the theme of "simple procedures produce complex macroscopic patterns"
- Related to phyllotaxy, Fibonacci sequence, quasicrystal structure, etc.
