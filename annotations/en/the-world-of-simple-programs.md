# The World of Simple Programs

"The World of Simple Programs" refers to the vast, explorable universe of all possible computational systems that can be defined by simple rules. It is a central concept in "A New Kind of Science", representing a shift from studying specific, often complex, human-engineered programs to systematically exploring the most basic programs possible.

## The Exploration

Instead of starting with a complex goal and trying to build a program to achieve it, this approach involves:

1.  **Enumerating Possibilities**: Defining a class of simple systems (like elementary cellular automata) and systematically listing every possible rule.
2.  **Running Experiments**: Executing each program from a simple initial condition.
3.  **Observing the Outcome**: Treating the output not as the answer to a predefined problem, but as a phenomenon to be studied in its own right, much like a naturalist studying organisms in an ecosystem.

## Key Findings

This exploration reveals that the computational universe is full of surprising and unexpected behavior:

- **Complexity is Common**: Complex and seemingly intelligent behavior is not a rare exception found only in systems like the brain or in complex human software. It is a common, almost inevitable feature of the world of simple programs.
- **Universality**: The same fundamental types of behavior (the four classes) appear again and again across many different kinds of systems, suggesting deep, universal laws of computation.

## Significance

By studying this world of simple programs, we can gain fundamental insights into how complexity arises in the natural world. The hypothesis is that many natural systems, from the formation of snowflakes to the patterns on a seashell to the workings of life itself, may be governed by rules that are, at their core, just as simple as those explored in this computational universe.
