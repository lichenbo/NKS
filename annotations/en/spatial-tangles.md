# Topological Tangle

In a network or continuous medium, topological tangles (Knots) refer to local structures that cannot be eliminated without destroying connections. They can serve as carriers of conserved quantities or particle properties.

## Core points
- **Topological Invariants**: Tangles are distinguished from other configurations by topological characteristics (such as number of rings, number of links).
- **Rule-protected**: During network replacement or spatial evolution, specific rules conserve the tangled structure, making it behave as a persistent object.
- **Physical Analogy**: Echoes the entanglement of magnetic field lines, fluid vortex rings, and topological defects in field theory.

## NKS perspective
-Conserved quantities of particles in network models may correspond to specific entanglement patterns.
- Multidimensional cellular automata exhibit local structural entanglements, representing the storage and transmission of persistent information.
