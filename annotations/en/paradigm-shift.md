# science paradigm shift

Wolfram's "New Science" represents a fundamental paradigm shift in scientific thinking:

## Core Transformation

### From mathematics to calculation
- **TRADITIONAL APPROACH**: relies on mathematical equations and analytical solutions
- **New method**: based on computational rules and simulation experiments
- **Significance**: Beyond the limitations of traditional mathematical tools

### From reductionism to emergence
- **Traditional View**: Understand the parts to understand the whole
- **New perspective**: The interaction of simple parts creates a complex whole
- **Importance**: Recognize that the behavior of the whole cannot be predicted from the parts alone

### From continuous to discrete
- **Traditional Assumption**: Nature is inherently continuous
- **New perspective**: Nature may be fundamentally discrete
- **Impact**: Changed our understanding of space, time and matter

### From deterministic predictability to complexity
- **Old Paradigm**: Simple rules lead to simple, predictable behavior
- **New Insight**: Simple rules can create unpredictable complexity
- **Breakthrough**: The discovery of computational irreducibility

## Historical background

### Model of Scientific Revolution
This shift is similar to other major scientific revolutions:

- **Copernican Revolution**: From geocentrism to heliocentrism
- **Newtonian Revolution**: mathematical description of the laws of nature
- **Darwinian Revolution**: Evolution and Natural Selection
- **Einstein's Revolution**: Relativity and Quantum Mechanics

### Kuhnâ€™s paradigm theory
According to Thomas Kuhn's ["The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions):

1. **Normal Science**: Working within an established paradigm
2. **Unusual Discovery**: Observations that do not conform to existing theories
3. **Crisis**: Abnormal accumulation causes confidence to waver
4. **Revolution**: New paradigm replaces old paradigm
5. **New Normal Science**: Research within a new paradigm

## Methodological changes
