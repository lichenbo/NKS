# Scientific Paradigm Shift

Wolfram's "New Kind of Science" represents a fundamental paradigm shift in scientific thinking:

- **From Mathematical to Computational:** Moving beyond traditional mathematical equations to computational rules
- **From Reductionism to Emergence:** Understanding how simple parts interact to create complex wholes
- **From Continuous to Discrete:** Viewing nature as fundamentally discrete rather than continuous
- **From Deterministic Predictability:** Accepting that simple rules can produce unpredictable complexity

This shift parallels other major scientific revolutions like those initiated by Copernicus, Newton, Darwin, and Einstein. Each paradigm shift fundamentally changed how we understand reality itself.
