# Complexity

Complexity describes that the system is composed of many interacting parts, and the overall behavior is difficult to obtain from the simple addition of parts. In A New Science it is often seen as a natural consequence of the long-term evolution of simple rules.

## Key Points

- Interrelated: components influence each other, producing non-linear effects
- Holistic: The whole shows new properties that are not found in the parts
- Multi-level: presenting different structures from micro to macro
- Irreducible: analyzing parts alone is not enough to predict overall behavior

## The difference with emergence

- Complexity: "how complex is the system now" (state)
- Emergence: “how” complexity emerges (process)

## Sources and metrics (brief description)

- Simple rules → complex structures: cellular automata, fractals, networks
- Information measures: entropy, algorithm complexity
- Structural measures: connectivity, modularity, hierarchy

Tip: Complex does not mean complex design; simple rules are enough to produce highly complex results.

## Wolfram Classification and Measurement

- Four types of behavior: I (simple stationary state), II (periodic), III (approximately random, such as Rule 30), IV (local structure and long-range interaction coexist, such as Rule 110).
- Distinguish between "random" and "structured": the structural richness of patterns can be evaluated using metrics such as compressibility/algorithmic complexity, chunking entropy, and Lempel–Ziv approximation.
- Computational irreducibility: Many complex systems lack shortcuts, making it difficult to quickly predict their long-term behavior except through gradual evolution.
- Coarse-graining and effective theory: Even if the microscopic rules are extremely simple, stable patterns and laws can still appear at the macroscale, making it easier to establish effective theories.
- Principle of computational equivalence: natural and simple programs are broadly close to universal computational power, and complexity is therefore universally available.

Complexity is one of the core concepts of A New Science, which challenges our traditional understanding of the relationship between simplicity and complexity, showing that complexity does not require complex causes but can arise naturally from the simplest rules.
