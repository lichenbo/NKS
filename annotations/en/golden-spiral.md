# golden section spiral

The Golden Spiral is a logarithmic spiral that gradually expands according to the golden ratio in polar coordinates. It is closely related to the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio. It is often used to describe geometric structures in plants, animals, and nature that exhibit approximately logarithmic spirals.

## Mathematical properties
- is a type of logarithmic spiral: `r = ae^{b\theta}`, where `b = \ln(\varphi) / (\pi/2)` and `\varphi` are the golden ratio.
- When the spiral rotates 90Â°, the radius enlarges by the golden ratio.
- Connected with geometric methods such as the construction of golden rectangles and Fibonacci squares.

## Natural and artificial examples
- Arrangement of plant branches and leaves, vines, and seed distribution.
- Shells, horns, galaxy arms.
- Composition and design in art and architecture.

## NKS perspective
- The golden section spiral embodies the complex macroscopic forms that simple growth rules and local constraints can produce.
- Echoes geometric structures generated by simple programs such as phyllotaxy models and Fibonacci replacement systems.
