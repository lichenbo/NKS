# Category 2 Cellular Automata

Category 2 (Wolfram Class II) describes the behavior of cellular automata that enters simple periodic or nested modes after a brief transition. Systems do not settle into a completely homogeneous state, but nor do they evolve into persistent chaos; instead, they form repetitive structures in some regions.

## Typical characteristics

- **Periodic Pattern**: An oscillatory pattern that evolves to a fixed period, or the emergence of a finite set of stable structures.
- **Local Repeating**: Often consists of blocks or striped patterns of limited size that repeat or move on a fixed track.
- **Limited Information Propagation**: Disturbance may remain, but is usually limited to a specific area, and information will not spread unlimitedly.

## represents rules

- Rules 4, 12, 36, 44, 132, 140, 164, 172, etc.

## Corresponding concepts

- Similar to **limit cycle attractor** in dynamical systems.
- In nature, it can be compared to repeated processes such as crystal growth and periodic chemical reactions.
