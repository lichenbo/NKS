# The Four Classes of Behavior

A central discovery in "A New Kind of Science" is that the behavior of simple programs, when observed, tends to fall into one of four fundamental classes. This classification provides a framework for understanding the entire computational universe.

## The Classes

**Class 1: Repetitive**
- **Description**: The system quickly settles into a stable and uniform state. After a few steps, the pattern either becomes fixed or repeats in a simple cycle.
- **Analogy**: A pendulum coming to a stop, or a crystal forming a regular lattice.

**Class 2: Nested**
- **Description**: The system produces regular, self-similar patterns where structures are nested inside larger versions of themselves. This often results in intricate fractal-like shapes.
- **Analogy**: The branching of a tree or the structure of a snowflake.

**Class 3: Random**
- **Description**: The system's behavior appears chaotic and random, with no discernible order or predictable patterns. It resembles statistical noise.
- **Analogy**: The molecules in a gas, or the static on a television screen.

**Class 4: Complex**
- **Description**: This is the most intriguing class. The system generates a mixture of order and randomness. It features localized structures that can move, interact, and persist over time. These structures can be seen as primitive forms of information processing, carrying and modifying data as they interact.
- **Analogy**: The complex interactions within a living organism, or the flow of information in a computer.

## Significance

The existence of these four classes is a universal phenomenon, appearing across a vast range of different computational systems. The discovery of Class 4 behavior is particularly important, as it suggests that the ability to support complex computation is not a rare or delicate property, but a common feature of the computational universe. This has profound implications for understanding how complexity arises in nature.
