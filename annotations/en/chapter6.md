Chapter 6: Starting with Randomness

The first part of the book focuses on the behavior of simple programs starting from simple initial conditions, such as a single black cell. Chapter 6 investigates the opposite extreme: what happens when these same programs start in a state of maximum disorder—completely random cell configurations? 37 The central finding proposed is the powerful phenomenon of self‐organization: many systems spontaneously generate order and structure when simple deterministic rules are repeatedly applied, effectively filtering and destroying initial randomness. 37

This chapter revisits the four-category classification scheme and analyzes how systems in each category respond to random initial conditions:
Category 1 and Category 2 Systems: These systems act as powerful "filters" for randomness. Whatever the initial state of chaos, they rapidly evolve into their characteristic simple attractors—either a uniform stationary state (Category 1) or a regular periodic pattern (Category 2). The initial randomness is quickly erased, suggesting that the rules themselves are the dominant determinant of the long-term behavior of the system. 37
Category 3 Systems: These systems tend to maintain randomness. While the specific patterns change, the overall statistical properties of the system remain seemingly random. They behave as "amplifiers of randomness" in which the initial disorder continues indefinitely. 37
Category 4 Systems: These systems exhibit the most complex responses. They don't simply erase or preserve randomness; they organize it. Starting from a random state, Category 4 systems like Rule 110 often evolve into a complex "soup" or "gas" of persistent local structures (often called "gliders" or "ships"). These structures then move within the background and interact in complex and unpredictable ways, creating a dynamic and complex ecosystem from the initial disorder. 37
This exploration leads to a deeper discussion of concepts in dynamical systems theory, such as attractors. An attractor is a state or set of states toward which a system evolves over time. For Category 1 and Category 2 systems, the attractor is simple and predictable. For Category 4 systems, attractors are complex, dynamic states of interacting local structures. 38 This chapter also touches on sensitivity to initial conditions, noting that while small changes in random initial states may lead to different specific outcomes, the overall qualitative category of behavior is a robust property of the rules themselves. 38

The profound implication of this chapter is to reinforce the primacy of rules over initial conditions in determining the basic characteristics of system behavior. In many areas of traditional physics, especially cosmology, the importance of the precise initial conditions of the universe is given great significance. This chapter proposes an alternative view: if the universe is governed by a simple program, its large-scale structure and complexity may be intrinsic properties of the program's rules, a feature that will emerge from a variety of initial states, including completely random ones. This kind of reasoning reduces the need for precisely tuned initial conditions to explain the order and complexity observed in our world, providing a computational alternative to arguments like the anthropic principle, which Wolfram discusses later in the book. 40 The consistent message is that programs—fundamental laws—are the primary source of the characteristics of the universe.
