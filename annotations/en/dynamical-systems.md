# Dynamic System Theory

Dynamic system theory studies the general properties of "systems that evolve over time". Typical models include ordinary differential equations (continuous time), difference equations and iterative mappings (discrete time). Characterize long-term behavior through concepts such as phase space, orbits, and attractors.

## Core concepts
- State and evolution: x(t+Δ)=F(x(t)) or x˙=f(x)
- Fixed points and limit cycles: steady state and periodic behavior
- Bifurcation: Qualitative behavioral changes caused by parameter changes
- Attractors: points, rings, torus and strange attractors (chaos)
- Stability: Lyapunov stability, local/global properties

## Relationship with Chaos
- Sensitive dependence on initial conditions, positive Lyapunov exponent, etc. constitute the chaos criterion
- Chaos can occur in both continuous and discrete models (Lorentz equation, logistic mapping)

## Limitations and relationship to this book
- Limitations: Traditional methods prefer continuous, differentiable and geometric analysis, and are difficult to cover a wider range of complex behaviors generated by minimalist discrete rules.
- Perspective of this book: treating the system as a program, using simple rules such as cellular automata to directly demonstrate complex patterns and computational irreducibility, providing a different paradigm for understanding natural complexity.
