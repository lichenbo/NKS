# Electronic Noise Generator

Electronic Noise Generator is a type of device that uses electronic components to generate random or quasi-random electrical signals. It is commonly used to calibrate measuring instruments, test communication systems, or provide a physical random source for cryptography applications. Its output usually appears as a broadband noise voltage/current, which can meet specific spectrum or probability distribution requirements through processes such as amplification, filtering, and statistical shaping.

## Typical implementation
- **Thermal Noise (Johnson-Nyquist Noise)**: Amplifying random voltages across a resistor resulting from its thermal excitation, is one of the most common implementations.
- **Shot Noise**: Utilizes the discrete arrival characteristics of carriers in diodes, electric vacuum devices or avalanche diodes.
- **Breakdown/Avalanche Noise**: Work in the reverse breakdown region of devices such as Zener diodes to obtain higher amplitude noise signals.

## Application and Background
- Simulate channel interference or background noise in communications and radar systems.
- Provide a source of physical entropy to statistical or cryptographic algorithms and build hardware random number generators.
- Generate controllable noise textures in measuring instrument calibration, audio engineering, and art installations.

## Limitations and practical considerations
- **Memory Effect/Relaxation Time**: The physical characteristics of the device may cause time dependence in the output, making it difficult to obtain completely independent samples.
- **External Coupling**: Power supply ripple, temperature drift, and the electromagnetic environment can introduce detectable patterns in noise.
- **Statistical Shaping**: Even if the initial noise is close to a Gaussian distribution, additional equalization and bias correction are still required when converting to a binary random sequence.

These practical factors mean that the randomness generated by electronic noise generators is often only "approximately ideal" and may still leave behind predictable or exploitable structures.

## Association with NKS
In the NKS framework, electronic noise generators represent a classic example of the traditional view that randomness comes from the environment. Wolfram used this to illustrate that even if we rely on external noise to construct random numbers, we still have to face the inherent limitations of physical devices; in contrast, simple programs like Rule 30 demonstrate the possibility of "intrinsically generated" randomness.
