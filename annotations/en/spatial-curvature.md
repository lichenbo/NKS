# Space curvature

Spatial Curvature describes the degree of curvature of space geometry relative to Euclidean space and is the core quantity in general relativity. Positive, zero, and negative curvature correspond to spherical, planar, and hyperbolic geometry respectively.

## Representation method
- **Metric tensor**: distance measured by metric $g_{ij}$, with curvature derived from its derivative.
- **Ricci Curvature/Scalar Curvature**: Quantifies how curvature causes divergence/convergence of volume elements or geodesics.

## NKS perspective
- In discrete network models, curvature can be measured by deviations from node adjacency patterns, such as replacement by pentagons or heptagons in a hexagonal lattice.
- Simulate Einstein's equations through network replacement rules, considering matter and energy as sources of changing connection density.
