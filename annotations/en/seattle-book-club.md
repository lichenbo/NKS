# Seattle Cultural Salon Reading Club

Introduction

Mr. Zhang Yuanji, the founder of the Commercial Press, once said, "The best thing in the world is reading." The Seattle Cultural Salon Reading Club is a grassroots organization in Seattle, with one book per month, no matter the subject. In each offline discussion, we meet friends over books to share and protect the integrity, system, classics and romance of books. Your participation is welcome.
