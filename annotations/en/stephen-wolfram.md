# Stephen Wolfram

Stephen Wolfram (born in London, 1959) is a British-American computer scientist, physicist, and businessman. He is widely known for his work in computer algebra, theoretical physics, and the study of complex systems through cellular automata.

A prodigy, Wolfram published his first scientific paper at age 15 and received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Caltech at 20. In 1981, he became the youngest recipient of the MacArthur "Genius Grant" Fellowship.

In 1987, he founded Wolfram Research, which released Mathematica in 1988, a technical computing system that has become a standard tool in many scientific and technical fields. In 2002, after more than a decade of work, he published his seminal book, *A New Kind of Science*, which argues that the universe can be understood as a computational process and that the study of simple programs is a new and powerful way to explore science. He later created the Wolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engine and the Wolfram Language.
