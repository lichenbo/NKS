# Stephen Wolfram

Stephen Wolfram (born 1959 in London) is a British-American computer scientist, physicist and entrepreneur. He is known for his work in computer algebra, theoretical physics, and the study of complex systems through cellular automata.

A child prodigy, Wolfram published his first scientific paper at age 15 and earned a PhD in theoretical physics from Caltech at age 20. In 1981, he became the youngest recipient of a MacArthur "genius grant" scholarship.

In 1987, he founded Wolfram Research and in 1988 released Mathematica, a technical computing system that has become a standard tool in many fields of science and technology. In 2002, after more than ten years of hard work, he published his groundbreaking book "A New Kind of Science", which proposed that the universe can be understood as a computational process and that studying simple programs is a new and powerful way to explore science. He later created the Wolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engine and the Wolfram Language.
