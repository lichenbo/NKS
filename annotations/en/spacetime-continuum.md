# Space-time continuum

The Spacetime Continuum is a concept in modern physics that describes time and three-dimensional space as a four-dimensional continuous manifold. It is the core framework of special and general relativity.

## Core points
- **Four-dimensional manifold**: Use coordinates $(t, x, y, z)$ to describe the location and time of an event.
- **Metric structure**: The Minkowski metric $ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$ is introduced in the special theory of relativity, and is generalized to the metric tensor of curved space-time in the general theory of relativity.
- **World Line**: The trajectory of an object evolving over time forms a world line in space and time.

## NKS perspective
- Traditional continuous models can be viewed as the macroscopic limit of complex discrete systems; NKS explores the possibility of emerging continuous space-time with discrete networks or cellular automata.
- Study concepts such as causal networks and causal invariance, and try to recover space-time geometry and relativistic effects from discrete substitution rules.
