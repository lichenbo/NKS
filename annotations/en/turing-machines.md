# Turing machine

Turing Machine is an abstract computing model proposed by Alan Turing, which includes infinitely long paper tape, read-write heads and state transition rules, and is used to describe the limit of algorithmic computation. It is the standard model for defining computability and complexity in theoretical computer science.

## Structure
- **Paper Tape**: Two-way unlimited, divided storage symbols.
- **Read-write head**: Read the current grid at each step, write new symbols according to rules and move left/right.
- **State table**: Determine writing, movement, and next state based on the current state and read symbols.

## Role
- **Computability**: Computing power equivalent to modern computers (Church-Turing thesis).
- **Universality**: There is a single rule (universal Turing machine) that can simulate all other Turing machines.
- **Complexity Research**: Describe the difficulty of the problem through running time and space measurements.

## NKS perspective
- Turing machines, cellular automata, replacement systems, etc. simulate each other to reflect "computational equivalence".
- Act as reference objects in models such as "Mobile Automata" and "Network Systems".
