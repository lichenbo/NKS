Chapter 9: New Foundations of Basic Physics

This chapter contains the most ambitious and speculative claims in the entire book. Wolfram attempted to lay a new foundation for physics, proposing that the entire universe—including space, time, and all the laws of physics—might be the result of the evolution of a single, simple process. 49 This represents the ultimate extension of the NKS paradigm: a potential “theory of everything” rooted in computation.

This chapter explores several core concepts in physics from a computational perspective:
Reversibility and the Second Law of Thermodynamics: Fundamental physical laws are considered reversible at the microscopic level, but the macroscopic world is dominated by irreversible processes, as described by the second law of thermodynamics (the tendency of entropy, or disorder, to increase). Wolfram explored this paradox using reversible cellular automata. He demonstrated that even in systems with fully reversible underlying rules, their behavior can exhibit irreversible and seemingly random characteristics from most starting points. He argued that the second law is not a fundamental law per se, but rather the result of our inability to undo the complex calculations performed by the evolution of the system and the fact that "special" ordered states are far less common than "general" disordered states. 40
Conserved quantities and continuum phenomena: Physics is based on conservation laws (for example, conservation of energy and conservation of momentum). Wolfram showed how similar conserved quantities emerge in cellular automata. He also showed how discrete cellular automata systems can approximate behavior described by continuous partial differential equations (such as the diffusion equation) in the macroscopic limit, reinforcing the idea that continuity in our world may be an emergent property. 40
The Ultimate Model of the Universe: This chapter ultimately proposes that the universe is essentially a discrete network or graph whose structure is constantly updated by a simple rule. In this model:
Space is not a continuous background but is made up of a network of abstract relationships between discrete elements ("space atoms"). The dimensionality of space is an emergent, large-scale property of the connectivity of this network. 40
Time is the inevitable process of applying the underlying rules to update the network. It is computational in nature. 7
Particles, such as electrons and quarks, are not fundamental entities but persistent local structures in evolving networks—like gliders in category 4 cellular automata. 40
Relativity and Quantum Mechanics: Wolfram speculated on how the known laws of physics could emerge from this framework. He believed that updating the causal network of events could produce the space-time structure in special relativity. He also proposed that the multi-path system introduced in Chapter 5, which allows the existence of multiple historical clues, can provide a basis for understanding quantum phenomena. 35
This chapter laid the conceptual foundation for what would become Wolfram's Physics Project. 34 This was a bold attempt to reconstruct physics from first principles, replacing the mathematical language of traditional fields and manifolds with the computational language of networks and rewritten rules. Although highly speculative, it represents the logical end of NKS's argument: if simple programs are the source of all complexity, then perhaps the most complex thing we know of - the universe itself - also originates from the simplest programs.
