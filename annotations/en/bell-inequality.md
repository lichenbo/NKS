# Bell's inequality

Bell Inequality (Bell Inequality) was proposed by John Bell to test whether the local hidden variable theory can explain the correlation of quantum entanglement. Once an inequality violation is observed experimentally, local realism is incompatible with quantum predictions.

## Key points
- **Local Hidden Variable Hypothesis**: Particle properties are determined by pre-existing variables and follow locality (not affected by super-light speed).
- **Quantum Prediction**: The degree of correlation caused by entangled states exceeds the upper limit allowed by any local hidden variable model.
- **Experimental verification**: Violations observed by Aspect et al. and numerous subsequent experiments support quantum non-local correlation.

## NKS perspective
- In the framework of multipath systems and causal networks, violations of Bell's inequality can be explained by "clues" or non-local connections across branches without introducing superluminal effects in continuous space.
- Supports viewing quantum phenomena as the result of complex computational branching structures.
