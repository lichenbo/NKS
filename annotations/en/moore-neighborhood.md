# Moore Neighborhood

In a two-dimensional cellular automaton, Moore's neighborhood refers to the eight neighbors centered on the target cell and covering its top, bottom, left, right, and four diagonals (a 3Ã—3 square does not include the center). The opposite is the von Neumann neighborhood (only 4 neighbors above, below, left and right).

## Key points in the context of NKS
- Local to global: Just changing the neighborhood definition (8 neighbors vs 4 neighbors) can significantly affect the macromorphology (diamonds, circular borders, branching textures, etc.).
- The emergence of complexity does not depend on dimensions: on the same two-dimensional grid, the combination of different neighborhoods + rules can also cover the four typical behaviors of "uniform, repeated, nested, and approximately random".
- Structure and statistics: Moore's neighborhood often makes the isometric expansion approximate a circular boundary, and the statistical roughness and Front evolution will also change with the rules.

## Common usage
- Rule descriptions for the Game of Life (extended settings) and various 2D CAs.
- Sum (or quasi-sum) rule setting of "If there are exactly k black neighbors, it becomes black/white".
