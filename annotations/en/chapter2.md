Chapter 2: Key Experiment

After laying the philosophical foundation, Chapter 2 introduces the "key experiments" that serve as the empirical cornerstone of the entire book. The core question is simple and straightforward: How do simple programs behave? 13 To answer this question, Wolfram focused on the most basic class of programs: one-dimensional cellular automata (CAs). 11 The experiment involves a systematic, visual exploration of the complete set of 256 possible rules that govern these simple systems. 6

A one-dimensional basic cellular automaton is a system consisting of a row of cells, each of which can be in one of two states (e.g., black or white, 1 or 0). The system evolves in discrete time steps. At each step, a given cell's new state is determined by a fixed rule that depends only on its own previous state and the states of its two immediate neighbors. 6 Since there are 23=8 possible configurations of a cell and its two neighbors, and the result of each configuration can be black or white, there are a total of 28=256 such rules. 6

The core of this chapter is a detailed examination of Rule 30. This particular cellular automaton is a classic example of the phenomenon at the heart of this book: the inherent generation of randomness from simple, deterministic rules.
Rules: The rules for Rule 30 are defined by the output modes for eight possible neighbor configurations. In binary, this rule is specified by the sequence 00011110, which is the decimal number 30. 16 This means that, for example, the neighborhood of three white cells (000) results in a white cell below (0), while the neighborhood of one white cell followed by two black cells (011) results in a black cell below (1). 17
Behavior: When Rule 30 starts with a simple initial condition, such as a black cell on a background of white cells, its evolution produces a surprisingly complex pattern. The left edge of the pattern shows a clear, repeating structure. However, the rest of the pattern, particularly the sequence of cells in the central vertical column, appears random for all practical purposes. 14 Wolfram reported that a series of statistical tests for randomness had been performed on the output, all of which passed. 15
Significance: Rule 30 is considered a deterministic proof that complexity and randomness do not require complex rules, random external inputs, or random initial conditions. Randomness is intrinsically generated by the deterministic evolution of the system itself. 14 Wolfram believes that this discovery forces a radical rethinking of the origins of randomness in nature. It also requires a "new intuition." 13 Our experience with engineering and traditional science leads us to believe that creating complexity is difficult and requires complex design. Rule 30 states that in the computational universe, complexity is easy and can arise from the simplest means. 15
This chapter has also been the source of significant controversy, particularly regarding the novelty of its core claims. Critics in the scientific community strongly argue that the idea that simple, deterministic systems can produce complex, seemingly random behavior is a cornerstone of chaos theory, which had been established decades before NKS was published. 10 For example, ecologist Robert May concluded in a 1976 paper: “…we would all be better off if more people realized that simple nonlinear systems do not necessarily have simple dynamics.” 10 In defense of the “novelty” of his science, Wolfram often gave a narrow and incomplete description of chaos theory, almost completely reducing it to “sensitive dependence on initial conditions” (SDIC)—the “butterfly effect.” 10 This description ignores extensive work in chaos theory on the intrinsic generation of randomness through mechanisms such as strange attractors in dissipative systems where initial conditions are forgotten but chaotic behavior persists. 10 The rhetorical need to position NKS as a revolutionary break with the past seems to have resulted in a framework that distorted or ignored important prior work, a key factor in the often hostile scientific response to the book. 11
