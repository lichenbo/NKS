# Cybernetics

Cybernetics studies the general principles of communication, control and feedback and originated in the 1940s (Norbert Wiener, etc.). Its core is to maintain stability or achieve adjustment (such as "thermostat-temperature-heating" feedback) in a targeted system through a closed-loop structure of sensing-comparison-execution.

## Core elements
- Feedback: Negative feedback stabilizes, positive feedback amplifies
- Communication and coding: signals, noise, bandwidth and information transfer
- Control structure: sensors, controllers, and actuators form a closed loop
- Autostabilization/homeostasis: Physiological “homeostasis”, set point maintenance of engineered systems

## Representation and application
- Early work by Wiener, Ashby, Shannon, etc.
- Engineering control, biological regulation, social systems and organizational models

## Limitations and relationship to this book
- Limitations: In the early days, continuous/linear models or analog circuit analogies were mostly used, which made it difficult to describe a wide range of discrete and complex behaviors in nature.
- Perspective of this book: Use minimalist discrete rules (such as cellular automata, etc.) to directly generate and analyze complex patterns, reveal the computational origin of complexity, and complement the continuous-linear framework of classical cybernetics.
