# Von Neumann Neighborhood

In a two-dimensional cellular automaton, the von Neumann neighborhood only contains the four upper, lower, left and right neighbors (cross-shaped) of the target cell, and does not include the four diagonal neighbors. The opposite is the Moorean neighborhood (containing 8 neighbors).

## Key points in the context of NKS
- Local definition affects macroscopic morphology: under the same rules, under 4-neighbor and 8-neighbor, the expansion front may be rhombus-shaped or nearly circular, respectively.
- Behavior category preservation: No matter which neighborhood matching rules are adopted, the system can still exhibit four typical behaviors: uniform, repetitive, nested, and nearly random.
- Simplification and analyzability: 4-neighbor often brings more "sharp" geometric boundaries, which is helpful for analyzing local to global propagation and counting characteristics.

## Common usage
- In the two-dimensional sum (or class sum) rule, the number of neighbors determines the status update.
- Juxtaposed with molar neighborhoods to contrast the effects of local interaction ranges on macroscopic patterns.
