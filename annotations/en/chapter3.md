Chapter 3: The World of Simple Programs

After establishing the core phenomenon of emergent complexity in basic cellular automata, Chapter 3 addresses a key question: Is this phenomenon a special feature of cellular automata, or a universal property of computation itself? 8 The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate this generality by extending the experimental investigation to a variety of other simple computational systems. Wolfram plays the role of a naturalist of the computing world, classifying the behavior of different "kinds" of programs to identify general principles. 8

The investigation includes a variety of systems, moving gradually away from the simple grid structures of cellular automata. Systems explored include:
More general cellular automata with more than two colors or larger neighborhoods. 6
A moving automaton in which "active cells" move along a row of stationary cells, changing their color according to rules. 20
Turing machine, a fundamental model of computing involving a read-write head and movement along a magnetic tape. 10
Substitution systems, operating by repeatedly replacing blocks of elements according to a fixed set of rules, generate complex sequences and fractal patterns. 20
Label systems and register machines, which are other abstract computational models in mathematical logic. 20
Across this diverse exploration, the consistent finding is that in all these different systems the same basic types of behavior observed in basic cellular automata reappear. This leads to the core conclusion of this chapter: the emergence of complexity from simple rules is a robust and universal phenomenon, independent of the specific details of the underlying computational framework. 8

To organize this vast behavioral landscape, Wolfram introduced his four-category classification scheme, which he proposed back in the 1980s for classifying the behavior of cellular automata. 22 This scheme provides a qualitative framework for understanding the different types of results produced by simple procedures.
Category Defining Characteristics Behavioral Analogy Basic Cellular Automata Rule Example
1 Evolves to a stable, homogeneous state (e.g., completely white).	Fixed point attractor Rule 250
2 evolve into simple periodic or nested structures.	Limit Cycle/Periodic Attractor Rule 90, Rule 108
3 Evolve in a chaotic and pseudo-random manner.	Strange Attractor Rule 30, Rule 45
4 produces complex, localized structures that interact with each other.	"Edge of Chaos" Rule 110, Rule 54
Category 1 (Fixed): This type of system quickly stabilizes to a simple, unchanging state. They effectively erase all initial complexity and converge to a fixed point attractor. 6
Category 2 (periodic): These systems evolve into states that consist of a set of simple, repeating structures or nested, self-similar patterns. For example, Rule 90 generates the complex Sierpi≈Ñski shim fractal. 23 The behavior of the system is predictable and contained within a limit cycle. 6
Category 3 (Chaos): These systems produce seemingly random and disordered behavior, very similar to Rule 30. They are similar to systems with strange attractors in chaos theory. 6
Category 4 (Complex): This category represents the most complex behavior. These systems generate complex mixtures of order and randomness, with local structures that persist, move, and interact in complex ways. This behavior is often described as existing on the "edge of chaos" and is exemplified by Rule 110 and Conway's Game of Life. 6
This classification system plays a crucial narrative role in the book, providing a coherent map of the new frontiers of the computational universe that Wolfram is charting. It tames the confusing variety of output into a manageable set of categories. However, this practicality has itself been criticized. Many in the scientific and mathematical communities point out that this classification is qualitative, based on visual inspection ("It looks like...") rather than on strict mathematical definitions. 11 As a result, its practical value for formal analysis has been questioned, with some critics considering it a "nice try" but "essentially worthless for understanding the workings of cellular automata". 11 This highlights a recurring tension throughout the book: the methods and standards of proof of this "new science," which prioritized empirical observation and visual intuition, often conflicted with the formal rigor required of the traditional science it sought to replace.
