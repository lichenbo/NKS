# Chapter 4: Number-Based Systems

## Core Perspective
- This chapter shifts the discussion from novel computational models back to the "number world" of traditional mathematics, with the purpose of showing that complexity and the four types of behavior are not special cases of cellular automata, but exist everywhere when we look at numbers from a computational perspective. 26
- The key shift is to think of numbers as objects that need to be represented as strings of bits and manipulated step by step by algorithms, rather than just as abstract sizes. In other words, arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication are physical processes performed on sequences of numbers, and their evolution patterns can take on complex structures like cellular automata. 26

## Representative cases
### Basic arithmetic
- A simple incrementing sequence will have a nested structure after binary stacking, suggesting that "the simplest program" may also leave complex traces. 26
- The sequence of multiplying by 2 is a predictable left shift in binary, whereas when multiplying by 3 or 3/2, the sequence of numbers and the decimal part appear to have a triangular and nearly random texture, indicating that the complexity comes from the operation itself, not just the representation. 26

### Recursive sequence
- Linear recursion (like Fibonacci) produces smooth, predictable growth trajectories. 27
- When recursion allows the index to be determined by the previous term (similar to a self-referential Ackermann-like structure), small perturbations are gradually amplified, and the overall growth is superimposed on violent fluctuations, demonstrating the unpredictability of Category 3 formulas. 27

### Number theory sequence
- Prime intervals and the occurrence of primes of specific shapes exhibit persistent noise-like fluctuations; Wolfram views this as Category 3 behavior generated by a simple sieve method rather than an isolated puzzle of number theory. 27
- Other sequences based on simple properties (divisors of numbers, sums of squares representing numbers, etc.) are equally difficult to predict, reinforcing the idea that complexity is the norm. 29

### Mathematical constants
- Numeric expansions of rational numbers repeat but sequences of numbers for constants like π, e, or √2 pass various tests of randomness; Wolfram took this to be evidence of the inherent complexity of numbers. 17
- Under alternative representations such as continued fractions, rational numbers and quadratic irrational numbers maintain simple patterns, while π and ∛2 still show chaotic sequences, implying that complexity has nothing to do with representation. 17

### Combined functions and special functions
- Stack simple functions like Sin[x] and Sin[√2 x] to generate periodic, complex waveforms. 27
- The deep coupling of the Riemann zeta function with the distribution of prime numbers shows that a single function can encode extremely rich and unpredictable structures, the zeros of which remain an open problem in mathematics. 27

### Iterative mapping and chaos
- The shift map `x → FractionalPart[2x]` mainly exposes the numbers deep in the initial conditions, which belongs to "revealing the existing randomness". 10
Mappings such as - `x → FractionalPart[3/2 x]` continue to generate new information during iterations and are positioned as examples of the arithmetic process itself creating complexity, echoing the Category 3 behavior exhibited by Rule 30. 10

### Continuous Systems and PDE
- Cellular automata that allow continuous grayscale states can still generate rich textures and local structures from simple initial conditions, demonstrating that discreteness is not a prerequisite for complexity. 26
- Some partial differential equations of simple form also produce complex patterns similar to those of discrete systems, suggesting a bridge between the computational universe and the mathematics of classical physics. 26

##Methodological meaning
- Wolfram restated the time-honored problems of prime numbers, chaotic maps, etc. as "outputs of simple programs", arguing that they follow the same computational universals as cellular automata. 17
- This reinterpretation is controversial: supporters see a unified framework, while critics believe it downplays the rigorous deductive structure of number theory and analysis, potentially reducing complex historical results to visual inspiration. 25

## One sentence conclusion
Viewing numbers as sequences of programmed operations rather than as abstract sizes allows traditional mathematical objects to exhibit the same spectrum of complexity as new computational systems; complex behavior is thus characterized as a universal phenomenon that spans the discrete and the continuous, the classical and the modern. 26
