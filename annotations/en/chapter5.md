Chapter 5: Two Dimensions and Higher Dimensions

After establishing the universality of his core phenomenon across a range of one-dimensional systems, Wolfram investigates in Chapter 5 whether adding system dimensions introduces fundamentally new types of behavior. The core question is whether the complexity observed in one dimension is a limited case, or whether the same principle holds true in two- and three-dimensional environments that are closer to our physical world. 31

This chapter begins with the most straightforward generalization: cellular automata on a two-dimensional grid. These systems update the state of each cell according to rules that take into account its neighbors in a two-dimensional arrangement (e.g., the four primary neighbors or all eight surrounding neighbors). Many famous systems, including Conway's Game of Life, fall into this category. Wolfram demonstrated through numerous examples that two-dimensional cellular automata exhibit the same four basic behavioral categories identified in one dimensionâ€”stationary, periodic, chaotic, and complex. 31 Although specific patterns are visually richer and can form more complex geometries, the underlying qualitative nature of the behavior remains the same.

The chapter then moves beyond simple grids to explore more abstract and powerful computational frameworks:
Substitution Systems and Fractals: This chapter reinforces the connection between simple rules and complex geometry by showing how two-dimensional substitution systems can generate classic fractals and other complex patterns. 32
Networked Systems: This section introduces a key conceptual leap. The systems Wolfram considered were not rules operating on a fixed, static grid, but rather the elements were nodes in the network, and the rules themselves could modify the network's connectivity. 33 This is a profound generalization because it allows the structure of "space" to be dynamic and emergent rather than a predefined context. The evolution of a system is a process of rewriting the diagram. This move was crucial for the book's later ambitions, as fixed grids have inherent geometries (e.g., preferred axes) that are inconsistent with the isotropy of physical space as described by modern physics. In contrast, dynamic networks provide a matrix from which continuous, isotropic space may emerge over large scales. This idea is the direct intellectual predecessor of the Wolfram Physics Project, which relied heavily on the evolution of these hypergraphs to model fundamental physics. 7
Multichannel Systems: The final generalization introduced is that of multichannel systems. In all previous examples, applying a rule to a given state results in a single, unique next state. Multi-way systems relax this constraint, allowing rules to be applied to the same state in multiple ways, resulting in a branching tree of possible histories. 32 This branching structure is considered a potential model for understanding quantum mechanics, where a system can explore multiple paths simultaneously. It also formed the basis for the later concept of a "rule body" (ruliad), which is the entangled limit of all possible computational histories generated by all possible rules. 7
The overall conclusion of this chapter is that, contrary to what would be expected in traditional science where dimensions typically introduce qualitatively new phenomena (e.g., knots require three dimensions), fundamental features of computational complexity are largely independent of dimensionality. The same four categories of behavior were found to be a robust feature in all these systems. 31 The most important development in this chapter is not just the addition of spatial dimensions, but the progressive abstraction of the underlying computational substrate, from lines to grids and finally to dynamic networks. This advance is more than a technical generalization; it is a necessary step toward establishing a sound computational basis for the fundamental theories of physics.
