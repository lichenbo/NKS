# phase change

Phase transition refers to a sudden and macroscopically observable state transition that occurs at a critical point when the control parameters of the system change slowly. Classic examples include the solid-liquid transition at the point where ice and water coexist, the loss of magnetization of ferromagnetic materials at the Curie temperature, and the transition of fluids from laminar to turbulent flow.

## Key Features
- **Critical Threshold**: When parameters such as temperature, pressure, density, etc. reach critical values, the system state is forced to change.
- **Discrete results**: Even if the underlying dynamics are continuous, macro variables will show segmented or jump changes.
- **Scale Divergence**: Divergence of correlation lengths and fluctuation scales often occurs near critical points, leading to cross-scale cooperative behavior.

## NKS perspective
- Explain that simple local rules can also produce mutation behavior when parameters change, echoing the phase transition phenomenon in statistical physics.
- Support the idea that discreteness emerges from continuous mechanisms: even if the rules are smooth, the results may still be discrete or multistable.
- In cellular automata, similar mutations can be seen by adjusting the initial density or update threshold.
