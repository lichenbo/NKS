Chapter 8: Impact on Everyday Systems

Building on the theoretical connections established in the previous chapter, Chapter 8 uses the NKS framework to create simple computational models for various specific real-world systems. The goal was to demonstrate the practical power of this new modeling approach, showing that extremely simple procedures can often capture essential features of complex phenomena that have traditionally been difficult to model with mathematical equations. 44

Wolfram begins by discussing the philosophy of modeling. He believes that the purpose of a model is not to replicate every detail of a system, but to capture the basic mechanisms of its behavior. He argued that traditional models often become as complex as the phenomena they describe, whereas NKS methods seek the absolute simplest rules capable of reproducing core qualitative behavior. 44 Validation of these models is often visual and intuitive: does the output of a simple program look like a natural phenomenon? 44

The chapter then presents a series of case studies:
Crystal Growth: The complex symmetric patterns of snowflakes are modeled using a simple 2D cellular automaton on a hexagonal grid. This rule captures effects such as growth inhibition near newly added material, leading to the emergence of complex dendritic structures from simple seeds. This is considered an alternative to complex continuum models based on differential equations. 44
Material Fracture: The formation of complex fracture patterns in brittle materials is modeled by a network of springs in which connections break when stress exceeds a certain threshold. This simple model reproduces the jagged, often fractal path of a crack. 46
Fluid Flow: The notoriously difficult problem of turbulence is modeled using a simple cellular automata "fluid" model. These models consist of discrete particles moving on a grid and colliding according to simple rules. Despite their simplicity, they can reproduce macroscopic fluid phenomena such as the formation of vortices and turbulent wakes behind obstacles. 46
Biological Growth and Morphology: This section explores how simple programs can model biological development (morphogenesis).
Plant Growth: The branching structure of plants is modeled using simple replacement systems or rewrite rules that generate complex tree-like forms. 46
Biological Pigmentation Patterns: The complex patterns on mollusk shells are a key example. Wolfram showed that many of these patterns, from simple stripes to complex chaotic designs, can be generated by one-dimensional cellular automata operating along the growing edge of the shell. He believed that the pigment-secreting cells in the mollusk's mantle acted as biological cellular automata. 6
Financial Systems: The chapter ends with a brief and speculative application to financial markets, arguing that seemingly random fluctuations in stock prices may be better understood as the result of intrinsically generated randomness in the interactions of many agents following simple rules, rather than simply as a reaction to external news. 46
In each case, the argument is the same: a phenomenon that appears extremely complex and has historically required complex mathematical models can, at least in its basic characteristics, be captured by a surprisingly simple procedure. This chapter serves as a major body of evidence on the practical utility of the NKS approach, aiming to convince the reader that this is not just an abstract philosophy, but a new and powerful scientific modeling tool.
