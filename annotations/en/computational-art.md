# Computational Art and Aesthetic Beauty

Simple computational rules can generate pictures with striking aesthetic qualities, often reminiscent of nature but also uniquely new. This represents a fundamental shift in how art can be created—not through human intuition alone, but through the systematic exploration of computational possibilities.
