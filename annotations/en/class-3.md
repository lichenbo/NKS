# Category 3 Cellular Automata

Category 3 (Wolfram Class III) refers to cellular automata that quickly produce random noise-like patterns even from simple initial conditions. Although the rules themselves are completely determined, the evolution results show highly disordered and difficult-to-compress statistical properties.

## Typical characteristics

- **Persistent Disorder**: Patterns remain approximately random over long time scales, with no visible periodicity or large-scale structure.
- **Sensitive to initial conditions**: Small perturbations will spread rapidly through the system, causing global differences.
- **Statistical Stability**: Although the local area looks random, the overall statistical characteristics (such as black and white density) tend to be stable.

## represents rules

- Rules 18, 22, 30, 45, 106, 126, 150, 182, etc.

## Dynamic meaning

- Echoes the **chaotic attractor** in dynamical systems.
- Often considered a model for deterministic random number generation, for example rule 30 is used for pseudo-random number generators.
- Display information diffuses rapidly and lacks long-term predictability.
