# Emergence

In the context of NKS, "emergence" refers to the repeated action of extremely simple local rules to generate macroscopically new structures and behaviors from the bottom up that cannot be directly deduced from the local.

## NKS Key Points
- Local → Global: Macroscopic properties are not a linear superposition of local properties, but the product of iteration and interaction.
- Four types of behavioral foundations: uniform, repetitive, nested, and nearly random can all emerge from simple rules, among which category 3/4 is particularly “strong emergence”.
- Irreducibility: For many systems, it is difficult to predict the long-term results faster except for gradual evolution; observation and visualization are the primary means.

## Representative calculation example
- Rule 30: Starting from the simplest initial (single black element) and minimalist local rules, continue to generate approximately random textures and long-range correlations.

- Rule 110: Produce persistent, interactive local structures ("gliders" and collision products) on periodic backgrounds, revealing the rudiments of information carrying and processing.

## The difference with "complexity" (brief description)
- Emergence emphasizes "generation process and mechanism"; complexity is more like "current state and degree".
- Emergence often appears as structured patterns (nested fractals, local structural interactions), which is not equivalent to unstructured chaos.

## Why is it important (methodology)
- Let go of the privilege of a priori equations: start from minimalist programs to do enumeration and visualization, and intuitively identify macroscopic patterns and laws.
- Cross-model consistency: Similar emergent structures appear repeatedly in different vectors such as one-dimensional/two-dimensional/network/multi-path, etc., supporting the view of “unprivileged form”.
- Engineering design-oriented: Use simple local rules to construct scalable, robust and expressive systems (parallel, decentralized, easy to combine).

## Natural Analogy (Overview)
- Biology: morphogenesis, signaling and regulatory networks, group collaboration.
- Physics: crystal growth, interface coarsening, turbulence texture and statistical laws.
- Society: collective patterns and institutional structures under the rules of individual interaction.
