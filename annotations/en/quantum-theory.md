# quantum theory

Quantum Theory describes the behavior of microscopic particles, with phenomena such as wave-particle duality, superposition state and non-local correlation as its core. Its mathematical foundation includes linear algebra, probability amplitudes and operator forms.

## Key Features
- **Superposition and Measurement**: State vectors can be linearly superimposed, and measurement causes the system to collapse to the eigenstate.
- **Uncertainty Principle**: Conjugate quantities such as position and momentum cannot be determined accurately at the same time.
- **Entanglement and non-locality**: There are transcendental classical correlations between different particles, violating Bell's inequality.

## NKS perspective
- Discrete models such as multi-path systems and causal networks can emerge with similar auxiliary quantum phenomena.
- Emphasis on generating complex probabilistic structures from simple rules and exploring the computational origins of quantum behavior.
