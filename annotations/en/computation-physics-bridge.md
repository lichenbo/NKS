# The bridge between the computational universe and the physical universe

Wolfram proposed a correspondence between the “computational universe”—the behavioral space of all possible programs—and the continuous universe described by traditional physics. In Chapter 4, the patterns generated by continuous-valued cellular automata and simple partial differential equations are highly similar to discrete cellular automata, suggesting that natural phenomena may be understood from a unified computational perspective, thus building a bridge between mathematical physics and computational exploration.
