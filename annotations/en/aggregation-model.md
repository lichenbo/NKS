# Aggregation model

Aggregation Model usually refers to a computational or physical process that generates complex structures by repeatedly adding particles or units to the edges of existing clusters, such as diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) or random walker adhesion models. In the context of NKS, such models demonstrate how simple local rules can produce smooth contours and morphology rich in dendritic detail at the macroscopic scale.

## Basic mechanism
- **Random walker**: Particles start from a distance and perform a random walk, and immediately adhere to the cluster after contacting it.
- **Local addition**: Each step only changes a small number of units at the edge of the cluster, no global optimization is required.
- **Morphological Evolution**: Long iterations can produce fractal-shaped structures, finger-like growth, or an overall outline that is approximately circular.

## NKS perspective
- Demonstrate how "intrinsically generated randomness" averages out smooth shapes on a macro scale, echoing the continuum model.
- Demonstrate that simple discrete rules are sufficient to explain phenomena such as crystal growth and discharge dendrites in nature without the need to solve complex equations.
