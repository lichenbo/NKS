# Rule 60

Rule 60 is one of Wolfram's basic rules for one-dimensional binary cellular automata. The update rule can be written as: the new central unit takes the exclusive OR (XOR) of the left neighbor and the right neighbor, which belongs to the additivity rule.

## Behavior Overview
- Produces nested patterns characteristic of Sierpinski triangles.
- Initial value redundancy is easily compressed and is often used as an example of linear rules.
- Behavior can be accurately predicted by linear algebra or binary convolution.

## Relationship with NKS
- As a classic example of additive cellular automata, to contrast the complexity of nonlinear rules (such as rule 30).
- Demonstrate in cryptographic examples why linear rules are easily broken.
