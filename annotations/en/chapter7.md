Chapter 7: Programs and Mechanisms in Nature

After an extensive exploration of the abstract world of simple programs, Chapter 7 marks a key turning point in the book's argument. The aim is to build a bridge between phenomena observed in the computational universe and phenomena observed in nature. 41 The central premise of this chapter is the universality of behavior: that the basic mechanisms responsible for common natural phenomena such as randomness, continuity, and discreteness are the same as those found in simple programs. This means that insights gained from studying simple procedures can be directly applied to understanding nature, regardless of its concrete physical substrate (e.g., molecules, cells, or abstract bits). 1

A major focus of this chapter is to provide a new taxonomy for the origins of randomness. Wolfram identifies three different mechanisms:
Randomness from the environment: This is the traditional scientific explanation that a system appears random because it is constantly affected by complex and unpredictable external environments. Consider Brownian motion, the random jittering of pollen grains caused by countless collisions with invisible water molecules. 41 In this view, randomness is constantly injected from the outside.
Randomness from initial conditions (chaos theory): This mechanism believes that randomness arises from our inability to know the initial conditions of the system with infinite precision. In chaotic systems, small changes in the initial state amplify exponentially over time, leading to unpredictable long-term behavior. Wolfram associated this mechanism exclusively with chaos theory, arguing that it essentially "tapped" the randomness already present in infinitely detailed numbers of initial conditions. 10
Intrinsic generation of randomness: This is a new basic discovery mechanism that Wolfram promotes, exemplified by rule 30. Here, randomness is generated by the deterministic evolution of the system itself, even starting from simple and fully known initial conditions. Complexity is created by the process itself, not imported from the environment or initial state. 41
This section reignites the book's contentious relationship with chaos theory. By presenting his third mechanism as a novel alternative, Wolfram was again seen by critics as misrepresenting the field. Chaos theory experts believe that the "intrinsic generation of randomness" is what their field studies, particularly in the context of strange attractors, where the system's own nonlinear dynamics generate chaotic behavior regardless of the accuracy of the initial state. 10

The chapter then extends this comparative approach to other fundamental phenomena:
Continuity phenomena: Wolfram explored the apparent continuity of systems such as fluid flow, arguing that potentially discrete systems such as cellular automata can produce behavior that appears continuous at the macroscopic level. This is similar to how a computer screen composed of discrete pixels displays a smooth image. 42 He uses this to argue that the continuity observed in physics may be an emergent property of a fundamentally discrete underlying reality.
Discreteness and the Origins of Simple Behavior: This chapter also explores why if complexity is so common, we also see simple, discrete phenomena in nature (such as different species of animals or quantized energy levels in atoms). He argued that these phenomena arise from systems whose rules lead to a finite set of stable attractors, corresponding to Category 1 and Category 2 behavior. 42
Ultimately, Chapter 7 argues that “new science” provides a more basic and unified explanatory framework for various natural phenomena than traditional science. It suggests that rather than looking for different complex mechanisms for each complex phenomenon, we should recognize that many phenomena are simply different manifestations of the same underlying computational processes—complexity generation, self-organization, and intrinsic randomness—that are clearly visible in the world of simple programs.
