# Partial Differential Equations (PDE)

Partial differential equations describe changes in continuous media, such as diffusion, waves, fluids, and quantum fields, through partial derivatives involving multiple independent variables. Chapter 4 emphasizes that even if the equations are simple in form, numerical solutions can still exhibit complex space-time structures that are very similar to patterns generated by discrete systems. This suggests that complexity is not unique to discrete models but is a common phenomenon across description modalities.
