# Complex spectrum of prime number distributions

Prime number sequences are generated by a deterministic sieve method, but their intervals and local densities exhibit strong statistical fluctuations. Wolfram sees this phenomenon as an example of a "complex spectrum": simple generative rule outputs with rich frequency components, pseudo-random characteristics and as yet unexplored long-range correlations. This chapter uses it to illustrate that, even in the most fundamental objects of number theory, complexity is the norm rather than the exception.
