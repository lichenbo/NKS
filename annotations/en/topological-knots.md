# Topological Knots

In the context of NKS, the reference to "topological kink structures" is mainly to emphasize the constraints of dimensions on allowed phenomena: a true "knot" requires at least three dimensions of space to exist and deform, and is impossible to achieve on a one-dimensional line or in a strictly two-dimensional plane. This shows that some geometric/topological phenomena do rely on higher dimensions, but this and whether complex behaviors appear are two different levels of issues.

## Relationship to the topic of this chapter
-Limited by dimensions: The conclusion is that topological objects such as "knots/links" rely on three-dimensional degrees of freedom; there is no corresponding phenomenon in a one-dimensional system.
- Conceptual separation: Although higher dimensions are required for specific phenomena, "complexity" (simple rules generating unpredictable behavior) is not therefore easier or harder to emerge.
- NKS perspective: Basic behavior types such as uniform, repetitive, nested, and approximately random can be observed in simple programs in one, two, and three dimensions.

## Intuition example
- Physical knots and links: "knots" in three-dimensional space that cannot be untied through continuous deformation.
- Knot-like structures in field theory/fluids: such as some vortex tubes or entanglements of field lines, which require three dimensions to be presented stably.
