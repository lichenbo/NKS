# Undecidability

Undecidability refers to a decision-making problem for which no algorithm can give a definite "yes/no" answer to all inputs. Classic examples include the halting problem, which proves that undecidable propositions exist in any sufficiently strong system.

## Key points
- **The Halt Problem**: There is no universal way to decide whether a program will halt.
- **GÃ¶del's incompleteness**: There are statements in a formal system that cannot be proven true or false.
- **Turing Machines and Multipath Systems**: Branching structures or computational irreducibility make it impossible to predict outcomes "ahead of time".

## NKS association
- can be seen as a direct consequence of computational irreducibility;
- Critical to understanding the limits of mathematical and physical theories.
