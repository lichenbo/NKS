# Universality

Universality refers to the ability of a computing system to simulate any other computing system and is a key concept in measuring computational complexity. A system that achieves universality can perform any computable task.

## Features
- **Simulation Capability**: Coding exists that enables the system to simulate arbitrary target computations.
- **Computational upper bound**: Ubiquitous systems can simulate each other and have the same computing power.
- **Threshold Phenomenon**: From simple/predictable behavior to universality, the complexity increases significantly.

## NKS perspective
- Cellular automata (such as rule 110), Turing machines, replacement systems, etc. can all achieve universality.
- Support "computational equivalence": most non-trivial systems eventually reach the same level of computing power.
