# Three body problem

The three-body problem refers to predicting the specific trajectory of the evolution of three mutually attracted celestial bodies over time under the classical Newtonian gravity framework. Unlike the two-body problem, the three-body problem generally lacks a closed analytical solution and is one of the earliest and most famous examples of chaotic dynamics.

## Core points
- **No universal analytical solution**: Except for a few symmetry or restricted cases, it is impossible to write a simple formula describing the orbit.
- **Sensitive dependence on initial conditions**: Small initial differences can lead to completely different long-term behaviors, which is the classic stage of the "butterfly effect" of chaos theory.
- **Conservation of energy and angular momentum**: Although the trajectory is highly complex, the overall system still follows the conservation constraints of Newtonian dynamics.

## NKS context
- Poincaré systematically revealed the chaotic behavior in deterministic systems for the first time when studying the three-body problem, laying the foundation for NKS that later emphasized "intrinsic complexity".
- It shows that even if the laws of physics are completely deterministic, they can be computationally irreducible and actually random.

## Typical variations
- **Restricted three-body problem**: Assume that the mass of one of the celestial bodies is negligible, which facilitates the analysis of structures such as Lagrangian points.
- **Sun-Earth-Moon System**: An important example of celestial mechanics in reality, which requires numerical integration to solve.
- **Multi-body promotion**: When the number of objects increases, the complexity rises rapidly, highlighting the importance of calculation methods.
