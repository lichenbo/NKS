#artificial life

Artificial Life (A-Life) studies systems such as computing, robotics, or artificial chemistry that generate life-like behaviors and organizational forms through simple rules, such as self-sustainment, self-replication, adaptation, and evolution.

## Key Features

- Bottom-up: Starting from microscopic rules, macroscopic life-like behaviors emerge.
- Simple rules: highly complex phenomena can be produced with extremely simple procedures.
- Emergence and Complexity: The properties of the whole are not the direct sum of the properties of the components.
- Different from AI: AI is multi-task-oriented intelligence; A‑Life emphasizes the generation mechanism of life characteristics.

## Common models

- Cellular automaton: such as Conway's Game of Life, Sum Rule and Rule 110, etc.
- Agent-based model: A large number of interacting simple individuals produce group behavior.
- Artificial Chemistry: Abstract “molecules” and reaction rules form a metabolic-like network.
- Evolutionary computing: the evolution of rules and structures such as genetic algorithms and genetic programming.

## Working relationship with Wolfram

This book shows that extremely simple programs can generate life-like complex behaviors and reveal their basic mechanisms more clearly. This is different from traditional A‑Life’s preference for complex models, which emphasizes the universality of “simple rules → complex behaviors” and the central role of computational irreducibility and computational equivalence in understanding the complexity of life.
