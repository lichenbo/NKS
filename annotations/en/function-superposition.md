# Complexity of function superposition

When several simple analytic functions (such as sinusoids or polynomials) are linearly superimposed, the behavior of the resulting function can become highly complex: the waveform does not repeat periodically, the spectrum exhibits a dense structure, and is sensitive to parameters. Chapter 4 borrows `Sin[x] + Sin[âˆš2 x]` to illustrate that even if the components are individually solvable and predictable, their superposition can still exhibit approximately random overall characteristics.
