# Conway's Game of Life

The Game of Life, often called simply "Life," is a 'zero-player game' created by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. Its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input from a player.

It unfolds on a two-dimensional grid of cells, each either "alive" or "dead." The state of each cell in the next generation is determined by four simple rules based on its eight immediate neighbors:

1.  **Underpopulation:** A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
2.  **Survival:** A live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
3.  **Overpopulation:** A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
4.  **Reproduction:** A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.

From these simple rules, a stunning variety of complex and evolving patterns can emerge, including stable "still lifes," repeating "oscillators," and "spaceships" like the famous "glider" that travel across the grid. The Game of Life is a profound example of how immense complexity can arise from a simple initial state and rules, a core theme of *A New Kind of Science*.
