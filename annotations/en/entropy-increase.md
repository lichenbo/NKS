# Principle of entropy increase

The principle of entropy increase is a common expression of the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system will not spontaneously decrease with time, reflecting the time arrow of macroscopic processes.

## Key points
- **Entropy**: measures the possibility of microscopic arrangements in the macroscopic state of the system; higher entropy means greater microscopic degrees of freedom.
- **Irreversible processes**: such as heat diffusion, gas mixing, etc. will cause entropy to increase.
- **Statistical explanation**: The increase in entropy comes from the majority of high-probability states, and the volume distribution of low-entropy states is extremely small.

## NKS perspective
- Simple reversible rules still show entropy increase through most initial conditions.
- "Entropy reduction" can occur in the initial state of special structures, but requires equally complex preparations as forward evolution.
