# mutation theory

Catastrophe Theory (Catastrophe Theory) was developed by Ren√© Thom and others in the 1960s and 1970s to study why the system state undergoes discontinuous "mutation" when continuous parameters slowly change. It classifies and explains the basic types of mutations through geometric analysis of potential energy surfaces or control parameter spaces.

## Core Idea
- Continuous drive, discrete transition: The control parameters change continuously, but the system response may suddenly jump.
- Geometric-topological method: Use low-dimensional geometric shapes to describe stable states and bifurcated structures.
- Basic classification: such as Fold, Cusp, Swallowtail, Butterfly, Umbilic, etc.

## Typical example
- Structural instability: sudden buckling of thin rods when pressed to critical loads.
- Phase change and hysteresis: Control the temperature/pressure to change slowly, but the macroscopic physical properties will appear transitions and loops.
- Behavioral switching: In social, biological or ecological models, slow changes in external conditions trigger state mutations.

## Limitations and relationship to this book
- Continuity assumption: Catastrophe theory is premised on a continuous model and focuses on a small number of discrete transitions that can be classified.
- Perspective of this book: This book emphasizes the direct generation and study of complex behaviors using minimalist discrete rules (such as cellular automata), without relying on continuous and differentiable assumptions; the resulting complexity often far exceeds the classification scope of traditional catastrophe theory.
