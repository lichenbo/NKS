Chapter 1: Foundations of the New Science

The opening chapters of A New Science are a manifesto that lay the philosophical foundation for the book's central argument. It begins by pointing out what Wolfram sees as a fundamental limitation of science as it has been practiced over the past three centuries: its overreliance on mathematical equations as the primary language for describing the natural world. 1 This mathematical approach, although surprisingly successful in describing simple, regularly behaving phenomena such as planetary motion, failed to provide a satisfactory framework for understanding complexity. 1 According to Wolfram, there is no fundamental reason to assume that the rules that govern natural systems must be limited to what traditional mathematics can describe; this is an assumption of convenience, not necessity. 1

As an alternative, he proposed a more general framework based on procedural concepts. The advent of modern computing has made it possible to conceive and implement a variety of rules far beyond what classical mathematics could encompass. While most actually used programs are themselves highly complex and designed to achieve specific, task-oriented goals, Wolfram's core idea was to conduct what he called "one of the most basic computer experiments": take the simplest programs, define them without any specific task, and systematically observe their behavior. 1

This experiment led to the fundamental discovery of this book: that even programs with extremely simple rules can produce profoundly complex behavior. This observation is considered a solution to what Wolfram calls "nature's greatest mystery": the secret of how nature generates so much complexity so effortlessly. 1 Traditional intuition stemming from engineering holds that building complex things requires complex blueprints. Wolfram's findings in the computational universe offer an alternative explanation: If systems in nature operate according to simple procedural rules (as he contends), then complex behavior is not the exception but the expected norm.

The chapter then outlines how this new program-based science will impact the major scientific disciplines. In physics, it provides a way to model phenomena that resist mathematical description. In biology, it suggests that complexity in biological forms may arise from simple genetic programs rather than just the accidental pressures of natural selection. In the social sciences, it offers a new class of models that may capture the mechanisms of human behavior better than traditional quantitative methods. 12

This chapter cleverly redefines the scientific method itself. Traditional scientific models are largely inductive, working from specific observations of the world to the formulation of universal laws. 6 Wolfram's method is one of deductive inquiry. It involves first enumerating a universe of all possible simple laws (programs) and then searching within this universe to see which ones might correspond to observed phenomena. This represents a major shift in scientific epistemology. The goal is no longer simply to analyze the world to find its single, true underlying law, but to synthesize behavior from a vast computational matrix and then identify which of these synthetic creations best simulate the world we see. This methodological inversion—from analyzing nature to exploring a possible natural universe—foreshadows more abstract concepts later in the book, such as the “rule body” (ruliad), the entangled limit of all possible computations. 7
