# Certainty (determinism)

Determinism describes a system in which, given initial conditions and rules, the next state of the system is uniquely determined, with no randomness involved.

## Key Points

- Fixed rules: the same input will always get the same output
- Repeatability: Repeating the experiment under the same initial conditions will give the same results
- Unlike predictability: determinism does not guarantee long-term predictability (see "Deterministic Chaos")
- Computational perspective: many natural processes can be viewed as executing deterministic algorithms

## Related concepts

- Deterministic chaos: apparent randomness and long-term unpredictability under deterministic rules
- Computational irreducibility: understanding future behavior often requires step-by-step calculations
- Emergence and complexity: Simple determination of rules can also generate highly complex structures

## NKS perspective

- Certainty ≠ Predictability: Even if the rules are completely determined, the irreducibility of calculation will make long-term predictions only through gradual evolution and cannot "jump calculation".
- Apparent randomness: Deterministic rules such as Rule 30 can exhibit nearly random statistical properties and can serve as a source of pseudo-randomness in practice.
- Initial conditions are "programs": Different initial seeds, like short programs, can produce completely different complex patterns under the same rules.
- Coarse-graining and effective laws: Simple microscopic determinism can present stable statistical laws and "effective randomness" at the macroscale.
