Chapter 11: Computation and Universal Concepts

Chapter 11 is the technical and conceptual core of the book's final argument, which provides a formal treatment of computational concepts and ultimately demonstrates that even an extremely simple system can achieve the highest levels of computational complexity. The core idea is that viewing a system through the computational lens of its execution provides a powerful, unifying framework that transcends the specific details of its underlying rules. 29

This chapter first shows how to explicitly build cellular automata to perform specific, identifiable computations. Wolfram provides examples of cellular automata designed to count prime numbers (using an analogue of the sieve of Eratosthenes) or to determine whether a number is odd or even. 29 This establishes that cellular automata are not just pattern generators but are capable of performing formal computations.

This leads to the key concept of universality. A general-purpose system is a computing device that can be programmed to simulate any other computing system through a fixed set of underlying rules. The discovery of universal computation in the 1930s (Alan Turing's Universal Turing Machine) sparked the computer revolution by showing that a single piece of hardware could perform any possible calculation with different software (initial conditions). 29

Historically, it was thought that universality required a high degree of complexity in the underlying structure of the system. For example, early universal cellular automata required multiple colors and complex rules. 56 The main purpose of this chapter is to overturn this assumption. Wolfram cited Rule 110 Basic Cellular Automata as his main evidence.
System: Rule 110 is one of the 256 basic cellular automata and its rules are as simple as Rule 30. It is a Category 4 automaton, which means that it supports rich persistent, interacting local structures ("gliders"). twenty four
Proof: This chapter outlines the proof developed by Wolfram and his research assistant Matthew Cook in the 1990s that Rule 110 is in fact capable of general computation. 24 The proof is a constructive proof. It shows how gliders and other structures in Rule 110 can be configured to resemble components of another system known to be universal - the loop tag system. By proving that rule 110 can simulate a general system, it itself is proved to be general. twenty four
Significance: The discovery that one of the simplest cellular automata is computationally universal is considered a spectacular and profound result. 58 It provides the strongest evidence for the view that computational complexity is independent of the complexity of system rules. Universality is not a rare and subtle property found in carefully designed systems; it is a universal phenomenon found even in the simplest corners of the computational universe. 59
The chapter concludes by arguing that this discovery forces a radical re-evaluation of where we expect to find complex computations. If a system as simple as Rule 110 is universal, it is likely that many systems in nature—from physical processes to biological organisms—also possess this ability. This idea is the final piece of evidence needed to formulate the final principles of this book.
