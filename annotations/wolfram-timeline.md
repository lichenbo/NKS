# Wolfram's Scientific Journey

Stephen Wolfram's path to discovering this new kind of science began remarkably early:

- **1972 (Age 12):** First experiments with cellular automata inspired by physics textbook
- **1974-1980s:** Early work and academic publications, missed key discoveries initially
- **1980s-1990s:** Created Mathematica, gained independence to pursue fundamental research
- **1990s-2002:** Decade-long intensive research leading to "A New Kind of Science"

His unique combination of early mathematical talent, technology development, and business success provided the freedom to pursue this ambitious intellectual project over decades.
